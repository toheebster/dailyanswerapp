",4/1/18,"1 Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. 3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.  (1 Corinthians. 15:1-4) ","Leviticus 1
","Easter is the day when Christians all over the world acknowledge what Jesus did on the Cross. He died to pay the penalty for our sins and reconcile us back to God. He saved us from eternal separation from our Heavenly Father. It is a time of remembrance and reflection on how Jesus changed our lives. Some believers have incredible stories of how Jesus brought them out of sin and brought them into His light. Regardless of how someone came to the knowledge of Christ, the bottom line is that those who have decided to follow Jesus can truly say that it was a journey worth taking. On this day, take time out to reflect on how the Lord Jesus changed your life. Is there evidence that you are transformed by God? Is the Holy Spirit living in you? I believe that every believer has a salvation story of the time when the Holy Spirit first opened their eyes to the truth of the Gospel. What Jesus did on the Cross has so much significance and so much power. There is no one on earth who is exempt from salvation; Jesus died for every single person in this world, regardless of what they have done in the past. Jesus has the power to cleanse us of all unrighteousness, if only we confess our sins to Him and believe in Him. Jesus is standing at the door of our hearts waiting to enter. He wants us to believe in Him, love Him and follow Him with our whole hearts. There is peace and joy in a life lived with Jesus. There is hope and love in a life lived with Jesus. Jesus gives us a purpose and He even wants to use us to reach other people, so they too can experience the redemptive power of God. The road may not be easy all the time, but we know that our lives would not be the same if it had not been for Jesus. 
 "," Take time out to reflect on when you first accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior. If you haven’t accepted Him yet, pray the prayer of acceptance now."," But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5) ","Lord, I thank You for transforming my life. I pray that your light in me will shine for all the world to see."ULTIMATE GRACE,4/2/18,"32 Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. 33 When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. 34 Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” 46 Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last. (Luke 23:32-34, 46) ","Leviticus 2
","We hear so many stories of people who commit cruel acts toward other people. There are countless stories of fathers killing their wives, mothers murdering their children and even young people opening fire at schools and churches. Many may remember a particular case where a young man walked into a midweek service at a historic church and shot and killed nine people, including the pastor. Someone looking from the outside would say that this young man deserves the ultimate punishment for killing innocent people, some may even say that he deserves to go to hell. But, one of the witnesses at the church, after hearing of the young man’s conviction, said that she forgave him, and she hopes he finds salvation and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.  Let us remember one true fact: Jesus died for everyone, including that young man. It may be a hard realization, but if that young man were to ask Jesus to forgive him, and decided to follow Jesus today, he would be saved. I have heard stories of people who were devout Muslims but later became saved. There are atheists who have given their lives to Christ. There are even satanists who have been delivered and are now walking with Jesus. The Scripture for today reminds us that those who persecuted and killed Jesus did so out of ignorance. Jesus even prayed that God would forgive them because they did not know the significance of their actions. During this Easter season, we remember that our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, willingly died for all people – even those who persecuted and brutally killed Him. Let us remember that Jesus’ act on the Cross is meant for every person. No one is too far from the grace of God. ","Just as Jesus extended grace to the criminals on the cross, extend grace to everyone, even when you feel they may not deserve it. "," But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)"," Lord, Your saving grace still works and the blood that you shed on the Cross still has the power to save. Open the eyes of the lost that they may receive you as their Lord and Savior"JESUS ON TRIAL ,4/3/18,"59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. 60 But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. 64 “You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.” (Matthew 26:59-60, 64) ",Leviticus 3,"Jesus’ life on earth was free from sin. Jesus was always honest about who He was, and He never denied that He was the Son of God. If Jesus led a sinless life, then how could He have been convicted? What accusation did the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin have against Him? When you read the Gospel accounts, you can see that there was always tension between Jesus and the religion authority. I believe it is safe to say that the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin disliked Jesus, not because He actually did anything wrong, but because He challenged their authority in the presence of the people. When Jesus confronted the religious leaders on their hypocrisy and how they used the Law to oppress the people, the religious leaders were threatened by Jesus’ knowledge and growing popularity. As the tension grew, the religious leaders wanted to find a way to frame Jesus so that they would have a cause to convict Him. Even though the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin tried to wrongfully accuse Jesus, Jesus had a higher calling and His focus was on His mission. He knew that the trials had to take place in order for Him to fulfill what He came to do. Jesus even said to Peter that “do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that said it must happen in this way?” (Matthew 26:53-54). So regardless of the persecution He faced, Jesus always kept His eyes on the prize. Sometimes, life can get burdensome to the point of wanting to give up. We may not face a trial as severe as Jesus did, but in our own lives, we all face something that can sometimes feel out of our ability to handle. We can get overwhelmed with life’s demands and we may not know how certain situations will turn out. There may even be people whom you thought you could trust who speak falsely about you or try to defame your character. But let us use Jesus’ example as a sign of encouragement. He was perfect, yet the religious leaders still found something to accuse him of. Through it all, Jesus never lashed out and He did not lose His focus. Let us always remember to focus on the Lord and know that He will fight our battles",Search online for scriptures that help people get through hard times in life. Read and meditate on them," But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5) ","Lord, help me to keep my eyes focused on you, even when life gets hard."KNOWING GOD,4/4/18,"8 But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. 9 But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? (Galatians 4:8-9) ",Leviticus 4,"We can agree that God knows us, but how does one get to know God? This is something many people have been trying to understand for thousands of years. Has anybody ever seen God? Is it possible to really know Him? The Bible says in John 1:18 that, “No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known.” (NIV). Jesus Christ is our connection to the Father. The only way to truly know God is to know Christ. Jesus Christ is the one who holds the key. The life of Jesus is no secret, the world knows of His teachings, but the most important thing to know is His death and resurrection. Understanding what took place on the Cross is essential to knowing the character of God. On the Cross, Christ endured the punishment that we deserved. God cared for us so much that He didn’t have to think twice about sacrificing Jesus Christ. On the cross is also where God shows us that He wants us to accept Jesus, because that is the only way into heaven. What was done on the Cross is also a display of the miraculous power of God, the power of resurrection, which is within us. Once we have come to know God, we should not move away from Him. We are no longer slaves to the world and cannot afford to be trapped by the enemy. That same resurrection power is alive today. James 4:7 says, “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” The devil has no choice and has already been defeated. Once we know the goodness of God, there is no reason to be anywhere else.
"," As you get to know Christ more, don’t keep Him to yourself, share your knowledge of Him with others. ","But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)
"," Oh Lord, reveal Yourself to me like never before. Strengthen me to continuously resist the enemy.""JESUS, OUR REDEEMER",4/5/18,"59 Then after about an hour had passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean.” 60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are saying!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed. 61 And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” 62 So Peter went out and wept bitterly. (Luke 22: 59-62)","Leviticus 5
","Of the twelve disciples, Peter can be described as the disciple who was impulsive, strong-willed and enthusiastic. Anyone who reads about Peter in the Bible would say that he had a strong personality that showed through his encounters with Jesus. But Peter also had some character flaws as well and he sometimes bit off more than he could chew. For example, when Jesus talked about how He was going to die, Peter was the one who was bold enough to rebuke Jesus for talking about death. However, Jesus had to correct him (Matthew 16:22-23). After the transfiguration of Jesus on the mount, Peter impulsively suggested that three tabernacles be erected to honor Jesus, Moses, and Elijah, but Jesus had to correct him again (Matthew 17:4). One of the most significant acts was when Peter boasted about never forsaking Jesus, but Peter denied Jesus three times soon after his proclamation of faithfulness (Matthew 26:33, 70-74). Regardless of Peter’s decisions, Jesus still decided to use him to establish the Church. Sometimes, we may think that we have to be a complete package before God can use us, but God may have to prune us before we can be used. In John 15, the Bible says that every branch that bears fruit will be pruned so that it can be more fruitful. Even when you mess up, remember that God has a plan for you. Jesus didn’t give up on Peter because he failed; however, Jesus was patient with Peter and lovingly restored Peter to service. God needed to shape and mold Peter into the man God wanted him to be, in order to establish the church. Peter was not a likely candidate nor was he perfect, but God saw potential and thus pruned Peter into a man of God. Sometimes, we can beat ourselves up when we mess up, but if you run back to the Father, He will take you in. Don’t give in to the devil’s lies that Jesus can’t forgive you or you’re too messed up that Jesus can’t help you. If you find yourself in a situation where you have sinned against God, ask Him for forgiveness and run to Him so that He can develop you into the man or woman He wants you to be. ","Run to Jesus any time you fall, He will surely take you back. ","But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5) ","Lord, shape me and mold me into the person you want me to be. ""GOD, OUR DELIVERER ",4/6/18," We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed. (2 Corinthians 4:8-9) ",Leviticus 6,"People all over this world are in search of a hope. We often read about one catastrophe after another and it’s as if we are almost numb to it. On one day, we might read a report about a terrorist attack by Islamic extremists, then the next day, it could be a random mass shooting in a public place. 
Regardless of the things happening in the world, we can still have hope – a hope that is new every morning, regardless of what event took place the night before. Christ truly is the solution to all the problems going on around us. If we ever find ourselves to be involved in a bad situation, Christ is the one who can bring us out of it by applying the Bible to that situation. Christ can also give us the protection we need in these situations. I’ve heard of devastating tornados tearing through whole neighborhoods, destroying everything in its path, but yet people are able to survive. When Christ is a part of our lives, many times, we come out of situations that seem utterly hopeless. 
Acts 14:19-20 tells us, “Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead. However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.” This Scripture is a perfect example of what Paul knew about his life. How is it that a man can be stoned and get up from such a horrible situation? It was the hope of his calling, it was God who delivered him and gave him the strength to carry on. Paul went through many difficulties during his life as a missionary, but he was not hopeless – he knew God would not forsake him. We must trust God to be our deliverer, the same way Paul did","Put all hope in the Lord, knowing that He is the one who will always have your back.
","But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)
"," Lord, teach me how to trust you continuously, even during difficult times.""A FORGIVING HEART
",4/7/18,"13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.14 “For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. (Matthew 6:13-15) ","Leviticus 7
","We have all been hurt by someone else at some point in our lives. What makes that pain even worse is when the perpetrator is a close friend or family member. When this happens, many times we react without even thinking about what we are doing. Following our natural instincts, we retaliate in a way that might not be Christ-like. Instead of responding with bitterness or anger, we need to slow down or maybe even remove ourselves from the situation. Whether the other person hurt you intentionally or not shouldn’t even matter. What matters is how you respond. If the other person does not know they offended you, they would not know to apologize. The Bible gives us many examples of how one can show forgiveness. The prophet Hosea, who was told to marry an adulterous woman, had to be a man of forgiveness. In those times, Hosea’s wife could have been put to death for her sin. What would have happened if Hosea was living today? Many would have told him to divorce his wife, and according to Matthew 19, he wouldn’t have been wrong in doing so. However, look at what Paul wrote in Colossians 3:12-13. “Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering, bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.” When someone does us wrong, we should not be quick to respond in an ungodly way. Think about all the times we have offended God and how He continues to respond to us in His mercy. The sacrifices we make in our lives are extremely minute in comparison to what the Lord has done for us.
", Demonstrate what it means to be forgiving. Ask for forgiveness when necessary and forgive others. ,"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)
"," Father, thank you for your forgiveness. Mold me to be like Christ, to be one with a forgiving heart."THE LORD’S BATTLE ,4/8/18,"And he said, ""Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the LORD to you: 'Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God's ... You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!' Do not fear or be dismayed;   (2 Chronicles 20: 15-17) ","Leviticus 8
","This scripture is an assurance you can hold onto when going through difficult circumstances that seem out of your control and overwhelming. There are some battles that you simply can't win alone or with your own strength. At times, the Lord tells you to take your stance in Him, be still and see His deliverance manifest. Most times, you need to take your hands off, stand back and let God fight for you. You need not fear what comes against you. Stand firm in your faith. God is aware of your situation. Though you may feel overcome when you look at your condition, the Lord sees the whole picture and sees your way of escape. You need to let God take control and fight the battle you are facing. He has promised that He is with you and will bring you through. If you are facing a battle today that seems prodigious, hand it over to God and let Him fight for you. He will work it all out, and make a way where there seems to be no way.","As a child of God, the benefit of sonship is yours. All the promises applicable to a child of God apply to you in your circumstances.  Keep this in mind in order to reinforce the feeling of reassurance knowing that God will fight for His own. "," For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth: to the Jew first and also to the Greek. (Romans 1:16)
"," Lord, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for keeping your promise to fight my battles. Allow me to continue to feel your presence always.""WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW?
",4/9/18,"31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. (Matthew 6:31-34) ","Leviticus 9
","Life happenings may bring anxiety but worrying only amplifies issues. Worry can usher us into a state where we cannot think clearly or sensibly about a situation. In those instances, prayer and working out a solution can’t possibly be effective if we are caught up in 'worry'. What of tomorrow? Tomorrow hasn't arrived; today is what we need to concern ourselves with. Don’t get anxious about things that may or may not happen. Give it over to God in prayer. You can find God's peace in your place of worry. Don't let worry take root, for it is all consuming. Also, it doesn’t ease the apprehension of the unknown. Faith and worry cannot manifest at once. With the Lord, you must choose one over other. Take your eyes off the 'what ifs' and place them on Jesus. The situation’s severity doesn’t matter to the Lord. You can always walk through it with your eyes on Jesus. Living with worry of tomorrow is not your portion. Leave it to Him to provide a guarantee of a wonderful tomorrow. ", I will let God take care of tomorrow. Allow Him to do so. ," For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth: to the Jew first and also to the Greek. (Romans 1:16)
","Lord, I cast my worries of tomorrow on you because in you, I am assured a good ending. ""TOWARD COMPLETION
",4/10/18,"3 I thank my God every time I remember you. 4 In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, 6 being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. (Philippians 1:6) ","Leviticus 10
","God continues to work in us, developing, improving and bringing to full perfection, the work He has begun. The work of sanctification begins the moment we receive Him into our hearts. He works on our carnal attitudes, beliefs, fears, pride, and our human nature in an all-encompassing way. He also plants godly seed that produces a spirit-filled nature. He cultivates this nature, watering and nurturing the seeds so they will sprout and bring forth the 'Fruit of the Spirit', as the Gardener described in John 15. He also helps us to grow in the gifts and talents He has placed within us and further develops them for the kingdom. Until we meet with Him in paradise, this work will continue in us. If you feel that God is not doing anything in your life right now – you are wrong. Remember, He who began a good work in you will continue until the day of Christ Jesus. He doesn’t begin anything He can’t accomplish. Don't give up - He doesn’t! What He began, He will finish.
",I will believe in myself because the King of the Universe believes in me. ," For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth: to the Jew first and also to the Greek. (Romans 1:16)

(Colossians 3: 1-3) ",Leviticus 11,"""Set your minds and keep them set on what is above."" As humans, we tend to lose focus. Some of us are deceived and wrapped up in concerns of this world. We ponder more on our acquisitions, life insurance, student loans, food, clothing and shelter more than the Kingdom of Heaven. As followers of Christ, we are made aware that our lives on Earth will determine our place in eternity. How we live and earthly concerns that consume us will determine our final dwelling place. Satan tends to deceive us, even believers, into thinking that there is time on earth to go here and there. Tomorrow is not promised. The time to do right is today so that our eternal security isn’t shaken.  We should be focused on and tend to things of eternal value always. Nothing else matters. We can't take anything we have accumulated here with us. Chasing things of earthly value and importance robs us of what really matters. We will remain discontented with worldly acquisitions only because they will never satisfy. Only things of eternal value will ever satisfy.

",4/12/18,"""...But no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong. This [peace, righteousness, security, triumph over opposition] is the heritage of the servants of the Lord [those in whom the ideal Servant of the Lord is reproduced]; this is the righteousness or the vindication which they obtain from Me [this is that which I impart to them as their justification], says the Lord..."" (Isaiah 54: 17) ","Leviticus 12
","This is another wonderful and sweet promise of God. As we walk in God's righteousness, no weapon fashioned against us will prosper. Nothing that is said against us negatively will carry weight. It will be proven false in the end. The truth will always prevail. Sometimes, people gossip and say false things about us to ruin our reputation. Satan sometimes tries this tactic. He tries his best to weigh us down with lies and deceitful thoughts in order to make us feel as if God will not prevail or His hand is not strong enough to protect us. We can take heart and ignore those fallacies. For we know the truth about God that if we walk uprightly before him with clear consciences, He will vindicate us.

(James 4:10) ","Leviticus 13
","God will never resist the humble. He exalts those who are humble themselves. When you acknowledge His might and sovereignty, you are humbling yourself before Him. The ‘feeling of insignificance' that we feel sometimes showcases God's awesomeness. It doesn’t mean that we should feel unworthy to approach God. Our humility is putting into action the idea that God is greater than us. We cannot stand before His perfection and holiness. All our good works are worth nothing in comparison to His faithfulness to us.  As we humble ourselves before Him, He will lift us up and make our lives substantial. God can't do much through us if we are haughty. If we think too highly of ourselves and abilities, we won't feel the need to rely on God. A humble person knows they need God's help and gives all the credit to Him. A proud person thinks they achieved everything in their own strength. Cast off the haughty attitude today and exalt the Lord with humble gratitude.

It's so easy to get caught up in the speech and mindset of the world around us. The empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense presented by equally deceived individuals will do nothing more than waste your time.  They provide nothing of lasting value.

","Humanly speaking, it is most difficult to praise God in the time of trials; yet, I have never seen the most rewarding, stress-eliminating weapon as praising God during your trials. The psalmist said, “I will bless the Lord at all times.” 
When you are in a bad situation or trial, your sadness will not resolve the problem. It will only keep you stressed out and make you sick. I have heard people say they are angry with God and refuse to come to church. The truth is that innumerable numbers of people are serving God and your unwillingness to serve Him does not reduce His power and ability to perform miracle in other people’s lives. Some take their pain out on the church and that is wrong because everyone (both the Pastor and the members) in the church depend on God. If God does not help you, no one can. Always know that if anyone helps you, it is because God led them to do it. So rejoice in the Lord.
David wrote the Psalm in the chapter today after the Lord saved him from a diehard situation where he had to pretend like a crazy man in the presence of a king. He was not smiling or happy when he wrote it. Even though, it was not a joyous moment, David chose to praise the Lord.
"," When I am faced with a difficult and trying situation, first, I will remind myself that if God does not help me, no one can. Secondly, I choose to praise God despite all.

","If you are one who enjoys watching cooking shows, you likely may have noticed that professional chefs have the tendency to adjust the ingredients they use in their recipe until they achieve the desired taste for the dish. Chefs will often be seen tasting and adding more or less of an ingredient as they are cooking. These chefs do not give up until they have reached their desired outcome. 
Reading these Bible verses reminded me of one of the chefs who kept adding ingredients and tasting to see that the desired result was achieved. The first ingredient you need to add to make you get the desired taste of the goodness of the Lord is trust. The psalmist said “Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him!” The second ingredient is the fear of the Lord. The psalmist said, “Oh, fear the Lord, you His saints! There is no want to those who fear Him.” I believe this is not a phobic fear of God but a reverential fear. 
When you begin to revere and honor God, He becomes the only source of hope and solution to your problems. Just like the chef relied on ingredients to make the food taste better, reliance on God is needed to achieve your expectations in life. As you keep adding more ingredients to food to get the right results, you can also add more of God into your life and situations. He is beautiful for all situations and is the joy of the whole world. Just keep trusting and having faith in Him. You will find out that the Lord is good and is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him.",I will not stop trusting and being faithful in my walk with the Lord. He is more faithful and will never forget my service of love and endurance.,I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. (Psalms 34:1) ," Lord Jesus, I thank you because you are faithful and will answer my prayers. Give me the strength to keep trusting in you and never stop walking in Your fear."BATTLE TRAINER ,4/17/18,"1Blessed be the Lord my Rock, Who trains my hands for war,And my fingers for battle 2 My lovingkindness and my fortress,My high tower and my deliverer,My shield and the One in whom I take refuge,Who subdues my people under me. (Psalms 144:1-2) ", Leviticus 17,"Your perspective and outlook on trials is very important to your victory. Sometimes, people get bitter or self-righteous because of their challenges. I was talking to a mother some time ago who was bitter about her husband. She blamed everything negative going on in her family on God and her husband. Every effort to reason with her that God is faithful, and her husband is not her enemy, was futile. She believed that the negligence of her husband caused all her trials and was frustrated that God was taking His time to help her. Her dependence was not in God and invariably, she never allowed Him to teach her hand to war.
 
The devil is your ultimate enemy. He may use a man, invade your body with sickness, instigate quarrel between you, your spouse or your loved ones especially your brother or sister in the church. It is therefore very important that you acknowledge the real enemy and rely on the wisdom, knowledge, power, and presence of God to help you to conquer the enemy.
 
When you take refuge in God, He will not only teach you how to fight the battle, but He will tell you the weapon to use. Each battle you face needs a different weapon to fight it. God knows and has all the weapons","When life’s trouble crushes me, I will not quickly shift blame or condemn myself. First, I will acknowledge the supremacy of God in every situation.  Secondly, I will acknowledge His love, care, and mercy on me.
", I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. (Psalms 34:1),"Father in Jesus Name, I thank you for your presence in my life and every situation. I know you are faithful and I totally depend on You. Please help me in Jesus name."RECALL PAST VICTORIES ,4/18/18,"20 Go forth from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldeans! With a voice of singing, Declare, proclaim this, Utter it to the end of the earth; Say, “The Lord has redeemed His servant Jacob!”21 And they did not thirst When He led them through the deserts; He caused the waters to flow from the rock for them; He also split the rock, and the waters gushed out. (Isaiah 48:20-21) "," Leviticus 18
","It’s a season of reflection for my church. We are reflecting on God’s goodness for 25 years. God had been faithful and made it easy on us in our moments of reflections because He started doing greater miracles this year than ever before. To commemorate this season of celebration, women that were trusting God for children in our church were having their babies. I believe that there are more testimonies lurking around the corner for those who are still trusting God for their own miracle of children and before the end of this year, they will cry for joy in Jesus name - Amen!
During one of the thanksgiving celebrations, there was such an unspeakable joy in the church that the reassuring presence of God permeated the atmosphere. I remembered exactly 20 years ago when we had our church celebration with the theme “I will do a new thing.” The presence and joy of the Lord was also noticeable in our midst. The evidence of His glory was manifested when God provided a new location to build His church. On the week of the celebration, an invited guest heard about our quest to purchase a land, and through divine connection and God’s provision assisted us in purchasing the land. God perfected the purchase by making sure that the real estate size and price was too good to be true. God will perform “too good to be true” miracles in your lives in Jesus name. Your expectation will not be cut short! 
Looking back on the past victories, I can truly say that for the last 25 years (since the foundation of the church), the goodness of God has not ceased and His kindness is forever more. ","Anytime I feel like losing hope and giving up on God, I will reflect back on His goodness and mercy that kept me alive. This will renew my hope for a better and greater tomorrow. ", I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. (Psalms 34:1) ,"Father in Jesus Name, I thank you that you have started a good work in me. Please perfect it to the end in Jesus Name.""MIGHTY WARRIOR
 ",4/19/18,"46 The Lord lives! Blessed be my Rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted.47 It is God who avenges me, And subdues the peoples under me; 48 He delivers me from my enemies.You also lift me up above those who rise against me; You have delivered me from the violent man.49 Therefore I will give thanks to You, O Lord, among the Gentiles, And sing praises to Your name. 50 Great deliverance He gives to His king, And shows mercy to His anointed, To David and his descendants forevermore. (Psalms 18:46-50) "," Leviticus 19
","An elderly woman once spoke to me about her properties that her family members were fighting to take over. Due to her limited mobility, they divided some of the lands amongst themselves and were bold enough to try to evict her from her current living quarters. She could trust anyone including her children who were also fighting over her properties. 
Not quite long ago, God fought her battle for her. A litigating company told one of the children trying to evict her that he would need her consent to do so. He was put to shame and his pride was shattered. This child, her biological child, used to come to the house to brag about evicting her. She kept praying and would go to every prayer meeting at the church. She once told me that she was tempted to seek voodoo men because she felt like cursing her own children for turning against her. Instead, she stuck to her faith and God delivered her and restored what was hers back to her. 
As this passage so rightly says, the Lord God is our deliverer and He delivers us from the hands of our enemies. This woman knew that her battle was not only one to be fought in the physical; she also sought the hand of God through prayer and reliance on her Heavenly Father. Whenever you are faced with the fiery darts of the enemy (whatever form it may come in), remember that God is the mighty Warrior who is on your side. ","During my battle, I will know the real enemy that I’m fighting and the weapon of warfare. I will fight the devil, my adversary, by forgiving those that offend me. Secondly, I will pray in the Name of Jesus, casting down evil imagination, pulling down strongholds, and everything against the Will of God for me. ", I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. (Psalms 34:1) ,"Lord, you are my strength. I know you have never lost any battle. In Jesus Name, I pull down every stronghold and powers militating against me."DELAY SEEMS FOREVER,4/20/18,"1I waited patiently for the Lord; And He inclined to me, And heard my cry.2 He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, And set my feet upon a rock, And established my steps.3 He has put a new song in my mouth—Praise to our God; Many will see it and fear, And will trust in the Lord. 4 Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust, And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.5 Many, O Lord my God, are Your wonderful works Which You have done And Your thoughts toward usCannot be recounted to You in order; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered. (Psalms 40:1-5) "," Leviticus 20
","Your trials are not designed to define your future. God does not intend for the consequences of your mistakes to define the destiny He has prepared for you. Your trials, errors or mistakes should draw you closer to God and not away from Him. God is waiting for you to come, confess your sins and repent of them. He wants to restore you and establish your steps.
Though in Psalm 40, we never knew why David praised the Lord or about the horrible pit he found himself. All we know is that he was in great displeasure that he described the situation as a miry clay. It must have been a situation that David thought that he would never overcome. He obviously felt the pain and darkness of the pit. This reminds me of Jesus’ pain on the Cross. Though He went through an hour of darkness when He could have summoned His angels to cause destruction on the earth; He waited on the Cross patiently for the Lord to perfect all that He had purposed for Him (Jesus).
When you find yourself in a terrible pit dug by a family member, you may need to wait patiently for God’s help. If you try to rescue yourself, you may find yourself severing ties before the due time of rescue. I don’t believe that anyone enjoys trials or waiting “patiently” for an unseen God but you build Godly character in your trials.
"," I will reflect on the goodness and faithfulness of God in the past when I’m waiting. I will wait without murmuring. I will wait in praise and see God setting my feet upon the Rock that is Him.
","I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. (Psalms 34:1)
"," O Lord in the Name of Jesus, hold my hands and pull me out of my miry clay; establish my feet to stay.""CORPORATE PRAISE
",4/21/18,"1Oh come, let us sing to the Lord! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation.2 Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.3 For the Lord is the great God, And the great King above all gods.4 In His hand are the deep places of the earth; The heights of the hills are His also.5 The sea is His, for He made it; And His hands formed the dry land. 6 Oh come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. (Psalms 95:1-6) "," Leviticus 21
","It is easier to praise God in a large multitude than alone. Many people say it is difficult to pray during times of trials. It is easier to stay home and away from others. In other words, they want to be left alone. This does not eliminate a bad mood. It is better to act opposite to the way you feel when depressed especially when it comes to fellowshipping together with others. The Bible tells us “not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but to exhort one another, as you see the Day approaching.” (Hebrews 10:25) It is also important to know that sometimes the devil orchestrate situations that causes stress which can lead to depression and feelings of isolation. Because the devil knows the great things that God wants to do in your life, He may try to abort them before they manifest. You need to be aware of his scheme! Sometimes, the devil brings unnecessary issues and may even inflate their magnitude. If you give the issue your attention, he would have succeeded in distracting you. Most times, he may use people close to you to achieve his aims.  Again, beware of his scheme. Don’t stay away from fellowship. Remember, “be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Peter 5:8)
"," Remind yourself of the importance of corporate fellowship. Even when you lack the desire to be amongst other people, encourage yourself to be in the midst of a supportive, Christian fellowship.
"," I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. (Psalms 34:1)
"," Father in Jesus Name, I seek you alone at all times. My heart and mind seek after you; help me to never forsake the assembly of others."THE FINAL AUTHORITY ,4/22/18,"8 “Remember this, and show yourselves men;Recall to mind, O you transgressors.9 Remember the former things of old,For I am God, and there is no other;I am God, and there is none like Me,10 Declaring the end from the beginning,And from ancient times things that are not yet done,Saying, ‘My counsel shall stand,And I will do all My pleasure,’11 Calling a bird of prey from the east,The man who executes My counsel, from a far country.Indeed I have spoken it;I will also bring it to pass.I have purposed it;I will also do it. 12 “Listen to Me, you stubborn-hearted, Who are far from righteousness:13 I bring My righteousness near, it shall not be far off;My salvation shall not linger.And I will place salvation in Zion,For Israel My glory. (Isaiah 46:8-13) ", Leviticus 22,"I love this simple fact about God. He will do what He promised to do for you. He is the one that created you in the first place. He knew the day you will be conceived in your mother’s womb, the date of your birth and ultimately, decided your family. He knows about the kind of life experience that will come your way while growing up, both bad or good, and He has given you power over them all. I have come to respect Joyce Meyer so much. Not only did she survive abuse and molestation by her father, she was willing to obey God’s instruction when He told her to forgive her father. She forgave him and took care of him and his wife, her biological mother. This is beyond what a human being will ordinarily do. It takes the special grace and ability of God to forgive such parents. The depraved mind of her father led him to molest her, take away her innocence, and ability to experience childhood normally. She lost her innocence. The only sense one can make from this is that God knew about it all. He knew what He wanted to do with and through Joyce Meyer. He knew that thousands of women would have similar experiences and that Joyce Meyer would be the one He would use for the abused women. God also gave her a husband that would assist her in fulfilling her destiny. With God, her destiny was not wasted.
"," When I am being treated unfairly and don’t feel like forgiving, I will pray for strength from the Holy Spirit to direct me to the path of healing. "," “Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, Who have been upheld by Me from birth, Who have been carried from the womb: Even to your old age, I am He, And even to gray hairs I will carry you!I have made, and I will bear;Even I will carry, and will deliver you. (Isaiah 46:3-4) ","O Lord, I cannot do this by myself.

","The children of the Queen of England are rich and have an inheritance passed down to them by their parents. Every child that comes from the loins of the Queen’s children are entitled to the wealth of the Queen. Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is the Lord over all things and every realm. He rules and reign in the kingdom and affairs of men. He does not rule over England alone but He rules over the universe. He is the King of all kings and Lord of all lords. 
Your inheritance and riches in Christ Jesus is unlimited. It is not limited to the geographical area in which you are living, but it cuts across borders and spreads everywhere the sole of your feet touches. What an amazing and unending inheritance we have in Christ Jesus. The most enjoyable part is that your inheritance does not end here on earth alone but it continues to eternity. It is important to note that the privilege of obtaining this inheritance is extended to family members only. It can be passed down and shared with family members who have confessed Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. Therefore, if you are yet to become a member of the family of Christ then you simply have to declare your willingness by confessing Jesus as your Lord and Savior. Then, you can enjoy the family’s untold wealth"," I will remain in the family and get continually plugged into the blessings of the family. I will not allow anything or anyone to unplug me from the family.

","When observing little kids who play sports in school, one will notice that they play with vigor. The moment they find out that one of their parents is watching, especially their mother, they want to show off so that they can get a loud cheer from their mother. Mothers are usually loud cheerleaders who make sure that they call the name of their child as they cheer on. It was a tough one when we were trying to build our church without sufficient financial resources. The contractors were demanding for money, the congregation had expectation of completion in two weeks and it looked as though it would not come to pass. When a friend with experience in building construction visited two weeks before the opening day, he made it seem impossible to complete the project within the time frame. We had just installed the insulation and were yet to put the drywall, ceiling, painting, and carpeting, just to name a few. However, our confidence was in God who told us that no matter our experience, we must not stop the construction. We harkened to His words and believed in Him. His words built our faith and kept us going. Lo and behold, we saw the realization of His promises. Know that God the Father is watching over you and cheering you on when you are doing His will. When you are doing all that He designed for your life, you will get the confidence to move on no matter the opposition.

Behold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.” 7 But the LORD said to me: “Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’ For you shall go to all to whom I send you, And whatever I command you, you shall speak. 8 Do not be afraid of their faces, For I am with you to deliver you,” says the LORD.

","Sometimes, when I look at Melania Trump, I marvel at the things God can do with the life of ordinary people. Melania is the First Lady of the United States and wife of the 45th president of the United States of America, President Donald Trump. Melania was not born in America. She was born in Novo Mesto, Slovenia and grew up in Sevnica. She joined the modeling world at the age of 16. She quit school to pursue her career. She worked as a fashion model for agencies in Milan and Paris, later, moving to New York City in 1996. Melania married Donald Trump in January 2005. She became a citizen of the United States of America in 2006. Within ten years of relocating to the United States, she met with destiny that will change the trajectory of her life. Though, she had a catalog of achievements between the age of 16 when she left home to meeting President Trump, however, nothing can be compared to the day the President was sworn in, and she was recognized as the First Lady of the United States of America. I guess what amazes me most is the fact that while she was still in her mother’s womb, the hand of the Lord was fashioning her to become a First Lady of America. Those who were sitting with her in the classroom in Slovenia, never knew that they were sitting in the class with a future First Lady of the United States of America. While she left school and was wandering all over the world modeling, she and everyone around her, never knew she was a future First Lady. Let me point out two important facts to you. First, God knew who He has created you to be and you cannot alter it. Sometimes the choices you make may delay it, but they cannot change God’s plan for you. Secondly, God is the maker of all things and does not take advice from any man to make you who He wants you to be. ",I will not be afraid of what man can do to me.

In other words, he was claiming that Christians and Muslims have the same God as their father, though; he does not believe Jesus is the Son of God or God the Son. There is a stark difference between Christianity (our relationship with Christ) and other religions. The most distinct is the preexistence of Jesus Christ before the world began. So, it is an error to equate our Lord, Jesus Christ, to other gods. It is a total misconception of Salvation in the Lord Jesus Christ when anyone compares Christianity with other religions. Some will even dare to say that we are serving the same God. The god they are serving has a beginning and an end but the Bible text we read today tells us that Jesus Christ has been in existence since the beginning even before creation.
 Jesus Christ cannot be refuted; He cannot be compared to anyone. He knows all things and can do all things. He knows those who will serve Him and those who will serve other gods, no matter the persuasion to come to Him (Jesus Christ). Look at it this way. Jesus knew that Judas was going to betray Him. He did everything right and expressed relentless love that should have changed the mind of Judas but unfortunately, Judas chose to serve and obey the enemy.

He comes into the life of anyone that desires Him. Over the years I have seen little kids, teenagers, as well as adults receive the Holy Spirit and His gifts as long as they open their hearts to Him. Cornelius was an unbeliever who did good works. He knew how to please God though he knew little about Him. He was not privy to the law nor did he know about the visitation of the Holy Spirit, yet he prayed with his household daily and gave alms. God recognized his good works and rewarded him; not in the kind of works that he did but with the Holy Spirit. God rewarded Cornelius with the baptism, infilling and gift of the Holy Spirit. When Cornelius knew that Peter was coming, he went and invited everyone he knew including his servants. While listening to Peter preach the Gospel, the Holy Spirit not only visited his household but everyone present which included family, friends, and even his servants.   Today, the Holy Spirit will fill your heart and the hearts of anyone in your household who opens their hearts to Him. A lot of people leave their house maids at home and go to church.

(Isaiah 41:17-20) ", Numbers 1,"What I enjoy most about our hope in Christ is the fact that we do not necessarily have to partake in the production of whatever we are expecting from God. We can just relax and trust God that has promised that He will do it. Now, it may not come in our own way or at our own time, we can be rest assured that it will come at the ‘right’ time and we will not be put to shame. Hopelessness sometimes develops from a condition that refuses to change. It creates a heart of unbelief, allowing you to doubt God, and causing you to wonder if He can deliver you from your present situation. Now, those unbelieving thoughts can develop into fear and fear can manifest into reality by bringing evil imaginations to life. Job says, “what I feared most has come upon me.” The most dangerous thing you can do when you are going through a diehard situation is to doubt God’s love for you or His ability to resolve your situation and save you from your problems. The Lord never rewards unbelief regardless of the cause. The best thing for you to do is to express your fear to the Lord and confess your willingness to trust in Him as your Father. Listen to the Word of God in the book of Isaiah, “who has declared from the beginning, that we may know?And former times, that we may say, ‘He is righteous’?Surely there is no one who shows,Surely there is no one who declares,Surely there is no one who hears your words.” (Isaiah 41:26) Think about it, if you do not trust Jesus, who else can you rely on and what else can you do to make the situation better?", I will go into worship and praise. I will worship God for who He is and his ability to do all things,"“Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, Who have been upheld by Me from birth, Who have been carried from the womb: Even to your old age, I am He, And even to gray hairs I will carry you!

(Proverbs 3:5-8)", Numbers 2,"When thinking of the gymnastic team on the beam during the Olympics, the gymnasts keep their eyes on the beam in their attempt to stabilize themselves.  Any distraction from looking at the beam can cause them to lose their balance, slip and fall. Anyone can be anxious. When I was teaching in an “alternative school,” there was a very nice and smart boy in my class. He is nice and able to focus in the class while on his medications. However, on the days he forgets to take his pills, he is visibly agitated, causing trouble, refusing to do his work and getting angry over everything. One day after his episode of anger, frustration, anxiety and bickering, I called his attention to his behavior. I wanted to understand his thoughts whenever he was angry and throwing temper tantrums. He told me that he had been in two foster homes within six months. Every time he was moved, his belongings got lost in the move. According to him, the thought of losing his belongings in school torments him. To make matters worse, his biological father promised to visit him and never came. This has diminished his trust level. He kept telling me that he does not trust anyone, and this makes him angry all the time. Well, in the school system, we are not supposed to preach the gospel to our students. So, what do you think I did? You guessed right. I asked him if it was okay to tell him about someone who could help him. In a very simple way, I introduced the Lord Jesus to him. I preached the Gospel of Jesus to him and He received Jesus as His Lord and Savior. He was determined to trust Jesus and because of this, I believe he was able to join a regular school later. Whenever fear grips the heart, we tend to lose focus. Fear causes anxiety which can lead to a loss in balance and subsequent failure. If anxiety is not properly handled, it may cause depression and other medical problems. Having faith in God is not the absence of fear but it is trusting and obeying God, in the midst of your fear. ",I will keep speaking God’s promises to myself even when I’m afraid. I will repeat them loudly until I’m not afraid anymore. I will take a conscious step towards my goal despite my fears. ,"Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6) "," Lord, I put my trust in you in all my endeavors. Please help me not to lose focus in Jesus Name."KILLER INSTINCT,4/30/18,"32 Then David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” 33 And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.” 34 But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep, and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 35 I went out after it and struck it, and delivered the lamb from its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard, and struck and killed it. 36 Your servant has killed both lion and bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.” 37 Moreover David said, “The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and the LORD be with you!” (1 Samuel 17:32-37) ",Numbers 3,"Sometimes, God gives you keen, tactical instincts. This means that He helps you to know the weapon of choice for different battles. This can also mean that he teaches you how to address different issues. Other times, He may fight your battles. In the story of David and Goliath, David remembered his past victories when he trusted God. King Saul wanted him to put on the king’s armor to the battle front when David wanted to fight Goliath. However, because David was not used to his armor or battle gear, he decided to use the ones he knew how to use. I think David would have lost the battle if he had fought with King Saul’s armor. Instead, David trusted in God with the weapon he had used with the bear and lion. I have seen circumstances where people relocated because their friends relocated, only to realize that this was not God’s plan for them. I have seen families fractured because of the loss of stability in the home from lack of spiritual support that could help the marriage. It is very dangerous to fashion your life after others. You should never allow peer pressure to cause you to move away from your destiny and calling from God. ", Listen to the Holy Spirit first and always; He is your greatest Counselor and has placed His instinct in you so that you can discern His direction for your life.,"Trust in the LORD with all your heart And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6)"," Holy Spirit, I open up to you.  My eyes are on you for my next direction. Please lead me in Jesus Name."RETROACTIVELY INVOLVED,5/1/18,"28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, For would you deceive with your lips? 29 Do not say, “I will do to him just as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.” (Proverbs 24:28-29) ", Numbers 4,"A common and easy way to be happy after someone has been unkind to you is retaliation. You can either retaliate in the exact manner that you have been wronged or retaliate in a worse manner. The fact remains that the matter will linger longer than if you were to allow God to avenge your cause. When God avenges on your behalf, He goes beyond the areas that you envision to take revenge. He can avenge your case better that you can. Most of the time, God wants you to be still and “know that He is God.” When God fights your battle, He is not only doing it for you, but He may do it to change others so that in the end, He is glorified. However, when you take matters into your own hands, spreading rumors about the other party and slandering their name, you are not exhibiting Godly character. Don’t retaliate or destroy others when they offend you. Rise above the offense and offer forgiveness. People might pretend that the matter is settled, and all is forgiven. However, when the offender is found in error again and others are destroying the person’s character, they are quick to add fuel to the fire by sharing their unpleasant experiences with the person. Wait! If you do this, then there is still some animosity in your heart against the person and you might not have completely forgiven."," When someone offends you, do not look for a moment to retaliate, or in a sneaky way ask others to do it for you; instead forgive and let God be the “Commander-In-Chief” of your battle."," Trust in the LORD with all your heart And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6)"," Lord, please forgive me for every slanderous word I have spoken against my neighbor. Help me to forgive and leave the judgment to you in Jesus Name."FAMILY BUILDING BLOCK,5/2/18,"3 Through wisdom a house is built, And by understanding it is established; 4 By knowledge the rooms are filled With all precious and pleasant riches. 5 A wise man is strong, Yes, a man of knowledge increases strength; (Proverbs 24:3-5) ", Numbers 5,"I was at a youth event ten years ago when one of the youths was asked about her expectation of her parents and she replied, “quality time.” She explained that she gets everything she wants from her parents even when she asks for more, but she is lonely. The latest trendy things don’t fill her heart as much as quality time with her parents. She said that her parents sometimes allow her friends to visit and have sleepovers in her house, but it is not the same. All their generosity and the freedom given to her cannot be replaced with the quality time she wants from them. Both parents thought that quantity can replace quality time for their child. It is very important that we apply wisdom in our endeavors because in the family described earlier, the marriage did not last, and the child was not the same during and afterward the marriage ended. Striving for material wealth is acceptable, but not at the expense of your time with God and your family. There are some things that cannot be bought with money in life and we need wisdom and understanding to understand this. The quality time spent with your child and/or spouse cannot be purchased with any currency. Children grow fast, and time lost in their growing years may never be regained. Also, the time spent with your spouse will help to build your marriage and family. According to our Scripture for today, you need wisdom, knowledge and understanding to have a great house.",Make a conscious effort to spend time with your children and spouse. You don’t have to go out every time but spend quality time together.,"Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6)"," Lord Jesus, I seek your wisdom, knowledge and understanding. Help me Lord to build my house for your Glory."LEAN ON GOD,5/3/18,"1Now it came to pass, in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem, Judah, went to dwell in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons. 2 The name of the man was Elimelech, the name of his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion—Ephrathites of Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to the country of Moab and remained there. 3 Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died; and she was left, and her two sons. 4 Now they took wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth. And they dwelt there about ten years. 5 Then both Mahlon and Chilion also died; so the woman survived her two sons and her husband. (Ruth 1:1-5) ", Numbers 6,"There is a staggering amount of people who work themselves into debt or sickness while trying to prove something to others. A lot of people are in this situation. I know someone who makes a six-figure salary, yet, complains that she has no money. She complains because she tries to show off her riches to those who knew her when she was poor. Also, she buys her children everything they request regardless of their need for them. She complains about lack and thinks the church is the reason for her lack. She was so stressed that she left the church. Amazingly, the church of God is marching on and her children sometimes come to the church programs without her knowledge. One can readily see it in their eyes that they are missing fellowship. If you leave your Rehoboth, a covering and “place of placement” because of offenses such as unmet expectations, unanswered prayers, etc., then your strength is small (Proverbs 24:10). Most times when you brave the challenges, stay put, and depend on God for provision and victory, you will be richly rewarded. God will never put you in a precarious position, though, He may test you. Know these two things. First, you are just going through and are not staying put. Second, it’s just a test. ",You must trust that God will neither leave nor forsake you in your trial period. You must also hold on to His promises in His Word. ,"Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6)
"," O Lord in the Name of Jesus, give me the fortitude in adversity; so that I can remain immovable and unshakable in Jesus Name."TRUST GOD ALONE,5/4/18,"9 Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “Behold, in my dream a vine was before me, 10 and in the vine were three branches; it was as though it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes. 11 Then Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”12 And Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days. 13 Now within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand according to the former manner, when you were his butler. 14 But remember me when it is well with you, and please show kindness to me; make mention of me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this house. 15 For indeed I was stolen away from the land of the Hebrews; and also I have done nothing here that they should put me into the dungeon.” (Genesis 40:9-15) ",Numbers 7,"Before becoming the Prime Minister in Egypt, Joseph must have been very disappointed in humanity. First, his own brothers whom he lived with all his life, ate, and laughed together betrayed him. I know that if Joseph knew about his brothers’ malicious intent towards him, he would have avoided running the errand that his father sent him to check on his brothers. I know that Joseph would have disbelieved anyone who told him in advance that his brothers would put him in a pit and eventually, sell him to strangers. Secondly, after finding favor with God and his master Potiphar, I’m sure Joseph did not think that his master’s wife would consider having an affair with him. He could not have predicted her desperation. I’m also sure that he would not have expected his master to send him to prison because of the lies told against him. Thirdly, while in prison, he interpreted the dream of Pharaoh’s cupbearer. Joseph prophesied of his restoration and pleaded with him to remember Him. Joseph’s prophecy came to pass but the Cupbearer did not remember Joseph when he got to the palace before the King. The story of Joseph is a story that most people can understand. It is a story of betrayal by family and work acquaintances, slander, lies, divulged secrets, abandonment, and intrigue. Jesus Christ is the only true friend and Holy Spirit, the only true companion. Trust in Him completely today. ", While it is okay to be good and nice to others; it is equally wrong to depend on them for your reward. Trust and depend on Christ alone. ,"Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6) ","Father in Jesus Name, I put my trust and hope in you. you alone are the truth. Thank you Lord."OBEYING GOD WHEN IT HURTS,5/5/18,"35 Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. 36 For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise: 37 “For yet a little while, And He who is coming will come and will not tarry. 38 Now the just shall live by faith; But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.” 39 But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the saving of the soul. (Hebrews 10:35-39) ", Numbers 8,"There was a situation that kept recurring in my life. I was being treated unfairly and my concerns were not taken seriously. Anytime I complained about the unfairness of it all, I was not even given the chance to complete my statements before I was judged based on unfinished statements and explanations. This went on for years and one day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Obeying God was not a priority once I decided to take my revenge. I had concluded that God was not on my side and does not care about my suffering because He wasn’t handling the situation as I expected. On the day of my revenge, I overreacted, and my reaction was seen by all. Now the offended (me) looked like the offender! How I wished I had kept receiving the unfair treatment and insults and just waited for God to avenge me. Eventually, God fought for me, but I had cast away my confidence in Him before then. Endurance is a virtue that every believer must have. It will keep your testimony intact. Despite all your trials, it is very important that you remain confident that Jehovah sees and will surely vindicate you. He is the “rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.”"," When you are being treated unfairly; do what is right; don’t destroy others just to get even. Most importantly, trust God."," Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6)"," O God in the Name of Jesus, give me strength in adversity to do the right thing."ANSWERED PRAYER,5/6/18,"1 There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah in the region of Zuph in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, of Ephraim. 2 Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not. 3 Each year Elkanah would travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Heaven’s Armies at the Tabernacle. The priests of the LORD at that time were the two sons of Eli—Hophni and Phinehas. 4 On the days Elkanah presented his sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to Peninnah and each of her children. 5 And though he loved Hannah, he would give her only one choice portion because the LORD had given her no children. 6 So Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her because the LORD had kept her from having children. 7 Year after year it was the same—Peninnah would taunt Hannah as they went to the Tabernacle. Each time, Hannah would be reduced to tears and would not even eat. (1 Samuel 1: 1-7) ",Numbers 9,"If I ask if you have experienced antagonism before, it is likely that you will say yes. If I ask how you felt about the experience, you will likely say that it is not an enjoyable experience. However, antagonism can work out for our good sometimes. In the Biblical example of Hannah and Peninnah, Hannah had no children but Peninnah oppressed Hannah because of her barrenness. Each year, Peninnah, Hannah and their husband, Elkanah, travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to God at the tabernacle. Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her till she is reduced to tears and not eat there. When we study the bible further, we realize that Hannah’s barrenness was not by accident. It was God that kept Hannah from having children! One year at Shiloh, Hannah rose up to Peninnah’s challenge and despite her anguished heart, prayed to God and made a vow. This led to her answered prayers. Sometimes challenges draw us into a deeper and closer walk with God. Most times, challenges reveal our humanity and lead us into total dependence on God, where we tell God, “If He doesn’t answer our prayers, no one can”. Peninnah’s antagonism of Hannah led Hannah to pray to God in a different way than her norm. It led her to press into God and she was rewarded with her son, Samuel. After this time, Peninnah’s taunts became irrelevant in Hannah’s life. Press into God despite the antagonism you are feeling or the naysayers. Cast your cares on God for He cares for you. May God visit you and meet your needs in Jesus name. ",I will not let antagonism lead me away from God. I will use those challenging opportunities to seek God more. ,"And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5)","Lord, I ignore every antagonism and seek your face today. Meet my needs, O Lord, as I press into you in Jesus name"TIDE TURNING,5/7/18,"4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Come close to me.” When they had done so, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! 5 And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you. 6 For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will be no plowing and reaping.7 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.8 “So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt. (Genesis 45:4-8) ", Numbers 10,"Many people who have dealt with antagonism knows that it requires a lot of wisdom and maturity to prevent situations from escalating. Antagonism means “to oppose or work against.” It can be experienced within a family, work, church, friends, etc. The example from the Bible that comes to mind is Jacob’s family. Jacob loved Joseph, one of his sons, more than his other sons and this was obvious to them. They hated him because of this fact. In fact, they hated him so much that when the opportunity to get rid of him presented itself, they were so eaten up by hate that they sold him despite the obvious hurt to the family especially their father. They even contemplated killing him before concluding on the decision to sell him! Note that the reason they hate him is not because he was a bad brother. It was a factor beyond Jacob’s control. Sometimes people may be antagonistic towards you for reasons beyond your control. Other times, the glory ahead is obvious that people might try to waylay you. In Joseph’s story, he went through Pharaoh’s palace to prison to becoming a prime minister.  God was faithful to him despite the challenges. No one can stop God’s plan for you. It might be delayed but it will surely come to pass. God surpassed Joseph’s expectation that even his brothers could not believe their eyes when they saw he had become the prime minister. Though they eventually apologized to Joseph, God had already vindicated Joseph. There are many lessons to learn from this story. First, people don’t need legitimate reason to dislike you. They may dislike you for factors beyond your control, but as much as it depends on you, be at peace with all people. Secondly, understand that no one can stop God’s plan for you. They can try but they will fail. The dreams that Joseph’s brothers antagonized him for led to his breakthrough in Pharaoh’s palace. Pray against every delay in God’s plan for you through antagonism. Thirdly, let God vindicate you like He did for Joseph. Do not repay evil with evil. In all things, demonstrate the character of Christ and extend forgiveness to others who knowingly or unknowingly sin against you. ", I will demonstrate the character of Christ and forgive others who sin against me. ," And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5) "," Lord, use everything the enemy meant for evil in my life, for good in Jesus name. "THE SUPPLANTER,5/8/18,"10 This son was our ancestor Isaac. When he married Rebekah, she gave birth to twins.11 But before they were born, before they had done anything good or bad, she received a message from God. (This message shows that God chooses people according to his own purposes; 12 he calls people, but not according to their good or bad works.) She was told, “Your older son will serve your younger son.” 13 In the words of the Scriptures, “I loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau.” (Romans 9:10-13) ",Numbers 11,"In the Bible, Jacob was Esau’s twin. The name Jacob means supplanter among other meanings. A supplanter is one who tries to take another’s rightful place. When their mother, Rebekah, got pregnant, the babies fought in her womb. She inquired about this from God and God told her that they would be rival nations. When they were born, Jacob, the younger son, had his hand grasping Esau’s heel. In the course of their lives, Jacob tricked Esau into giving away his birthright. And when it came time for their father, Isaac, to bless the eldest son, Jacob again with the help of his mother, took his brother’s blessing. After Jacob stole his brother’s blessing, Esau vowed to kill him. Though Jacob was the supplanter, God loved him and showed him favor. Even before He was born, it was told to their mother, Rebekah that the older son, Esau will serve the younger, Jacob. Though, God knew how conniving Jacob was, he had great plans for Him. It was the antagonism with his brother that God used to draw him closer to Himself. After Jacob stole Esau’s blessing, Rebekah sent Jacob away to avoid a collision with Esau.  On the way at Bethel, Jacob encountered God. He had a dream where he saw a stairway that reached from earth to heaven. He also saw the angels of God going up and down the stairway. At the top of the stairway, He saw God who spoke to him about his descendants, future and plans for him. This is one of the many encounters that Jacob had with God and it was when he was running away from his brother. Though Jacob was a master manipulator, He met his match in God. God can use anyone or anything to draw people closer. The bible says that He has good plans for everyone. If we would surrender to Him totally, even in our sins, He can transform us and use our lives for His glory.", I will allow God to transform my weaknesses into strength. ,"And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5) ","Lord, use my life for your glory. Turn my weaknesses into strength in Jesus name."PERSECUTED ,5/9/18,"4 Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. 5 God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. 6 So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.[b] 7 He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins. 8 He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding (Ephesians 1: 4-8) ",Numbers 12,"I remember being chastised as a child in class. My personality is usually quiet but whenever, the “class” makes noise, everyone gets punished. Of course, I felt the unfairness of the situation but usually the teacher does not allow explanations. Even if you could explain, you don’t dare mention names since you got persecuted for being a tattle-tale. One of our biggest examples in the area of the persecution was our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. In our chapter today, we learned that before God made the world, He loved us and chose us to be holy and without fault in His eyes. He decided in advance to adopt us into His family by reconciling us to Himself through Jesus Christ. Despite this love, Jesus who is God did not have an easy time convincing humanity of His true purpose. All His intention towards humankind was good, yet, he was often persecuted especially by the “teachers of the law.” The bible also recorded that in his hometown, due to familiarity of the people with him and his family, he only did a few miracles because of the people’s unbelief. They did not believe him! Persecution is not easy to bear especially when you are being persecuted for something that you know is right. It is possible that you are being persecuted like Christ or the sake of Christ or the Gospel. First, know that the Bible says that in this world, we will have trouble but do not fear because He has overcome the world. Secondly, know that there is a reward in Heaven for you. There is nothing that you suffered for His name that you will not be rewarded for in Heaven. In Matthew, Jesus taught the disciples that “blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness ’sake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.” Thirdly, it is for a short time because nothing lasts forever, even persecution. Jesus went through it and more for you. When you were undeserving, He went through the crucifixion and died for your sake. As you go through persecution, rejoice in the Lord because to be persecuted means you are taking a stand for Christ. Remain true to God and hold onto Him. There is a great reward waiting for you. ",I will be bold and not to give up my faith in the face of persecution. ,"And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5) "," Lord, I receive the boldness and strength to go through persecution with a victorious attitude knowing that you are my rewarder."RESTORATION,5/10/18,"8 Eventually, a new king came to power in Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph or what he had done. 9 He said to his people, “Look, the people of Israel now outnumber us and are stronger than we are. 10 We must make a plan to keep them from growing even more. If we don’t, and if war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight against us. Then they will escape from the country.11 So the Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves. They appointed brutal slave drivers over them, hoping to wear them down with crushing labor. They forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king. 12 But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread, and the more alarmed the Egyptians became. 13 So the Egyptians worked the people of Israel without mercy. 14 They made their lives bitter, forcing them to mix mortar and make bricks and do all the work in the fields. They were ruthless in all their demands.  (Exodus 1: 8-14) ", Numbers 13,"All over the world, you hear about the fight against injustice. This injustice could be towards a targeted group of people such as minorities, ethnic groups, religious groups, etc. In the United States, there are many different movements fighting against injustice. This has been since the beginning except things were handled differently then. A Biblical example is the Israelites in the Bible. The Israelites were Egyptian slaves. They became slaves because the Egyptians feared that the Israelites would over power them in a war due to their massive numbers. However, the more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread. In their alarm, the Egyptians worked the Israelites harder, hoping to break them. However, God of Heaven heard the cries of the Israelites and rose to their aid. There are many lessons in this chapter, but I will elucidate a few. First, the Egyptians made the Israelites slaves out of fear. The Israelites didn’t particularly do anything wrong. It is just the plan of the enemy to keep them beneath them, though, God favored them.  Secondly, the Israelites knew to cry out to God in their oppression and He heard them. Their deliverance required faith in God on their part. Despite what their eyes could see, they had to believe God and take Him at His word that He would deliver them. Thirdly, their deliverance was not based on their ability but on their total dependence on God. They had no power or wealth of their own. Also, they did not have the army or chariots like the Egyptians. Lastly, at the Red Sea, when it seemed like everything was at its worst was when God was at His best. God is a good God. Cry out to Him like the Israelites did if you are going through any oppressive situation today. Know that you are not alone. He will hear You when you call on Him today. ",I will ask God for deliverance from any oppressive situation that I am in today. ," And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5) "," Lord, you are my deliverer. Please deliver me from every oppression in my life."NEVER GIVE UP ,5/11/18,"1Now there was a famine in the land besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar. 2 The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt;live in the land where I tell you to live. 3 Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. 4 I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring  all nations on earth will be blessed,5 because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.” 6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar. (Genesis 26:1-6) ", Numbers 14,"Isaac is one of the patriarchs of the Bible. He was the promised son of Abraham and Sarah. After a famine struck the land where he lived, He moved to Gerar. God gave Isaac specific instructions about living in Gerar. While living as a foreigner there, God promised to be with Him and bless him. He was also promised his father’s blessings. In Gerar, God blessed Isaac exceedingly that he became a rich man whose wealth grew. This led to jealousy by the Philistines who filled his wells with dirt in sabotage. Finally, he was sent away by their king because he had become “too powerful for them.” He went away and dug many wells that resulted in controversy and he eventually had to leave them behind. While reading this story, one of the first questions that came to my mind was “didn’t God tell Isaac to stay in Gerar and that He would bless him if He did? If so, why was there so much animosity with the people of the land that he had to repeat his efforts to be successful? Why couldn’t God send him to another place where it would be easier?” Sometimes, we make the mistake of thinking that if God makes you a promise; there will be no challenge in accomplishing it. As we can see, though Isaac was challenged many times, he did not give up. Just like his father before him, Abraham, he believed God who promised to bless him in a foreign land and give him his father’s blessings. After seeing the tenacity of Isaac and God’s workings in Isaac’s life, the King of the Philistines was forced to reckon that God was with Isaac and made a peace treaty with him. What has God promised you that seems so long in coming? Does it look like your efforts are not coming together quickly? This does not mean that God did not speak to you. It also does not mean God has abandoned you or that you are a failure. A righteous man may fall many times, but he will rise up again with God’s help. It is not too late for you to rise up again. God may want to build you up before you possess some of His promises to you. Go back to God in prayer for more leading or clarification if you need to but don’t give up on God or His promise for your life. God will help you today. ",I won’t give up on God’s plan and purpose for my life. ," And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5) ","Lord, please help me to fulfill your plans and purpose for my life. I won’t give up so quickly on you in Jesus name."UNITY,5/12/18,"1As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. 3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. 4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to one hope when you were called; 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all (Ephesians 1:1-6) ", Numbers 15,"An antonym of antagonism or opposition is unity. Unity is a very integral part of being a Christian. All through this week, we learnt about opposition and antagonism among brethren, family members, brothers, wives and even nations. Just as antagonism and opposition is damaging, unity is very essential in the body of Christ. Unity can be defined as “harmony, agreement, or oneness of mind and purpose. One example of unity in the Bible can be seen in the Upper Room where the apostles gathered on the Day of Pentecost. They were together in one accord when the Holy Spirit came down. Now, we all have the Holy Spirit residing in each of us. However, in Acts Chapter 2, it was when the apostles gathered together in unity that the Holy Spirit came down in their midst. Another example was in the Tower of Babel when the whole world had one language and a common speech. Even God said in the book of Genesis of the people, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.” God knew that in unity of purpose, men can accomplish much. There are a few takeaways from today’s message.  First, do not forsake the assembly of fellow believers. Pray with the corporate body of Christ. It will build you up as iron sharpens iron. Secondly, pray in your family together. It will foster togetherness and keep the family flourishing as your prayers are answered. Thirdly, look for a fellow brother or sister to agree together in prayer when needed and see that stubborn mountain leveled before you. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. In unity, you can experience His mighty power and wonders. ",I will unite with fellow Christians to pray and see God move mightily in our midst. ," And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.  Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame. (Romans 5:2-5) ","Lord, as I join others to pray, answer my prayers speedily in Jesus name"A COMFORTER IN NEED,5/13/18,"10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem, And be glad with her, all you who love her; Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn for her; 11 That you may feed and be satisfied With the consolation of her bosom, That you may drink deeply and be delighted With the abundance of her glory.” 12 For thus says the LORD: “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, And the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream. Then you shall feed; On her sides shall you be carried, And be dandled on her knees. 13 As one whom his mother comforts, So I will comfort you; And you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.” (Isaiah 66:10-13) ", Numbers 16,"Today’s scripture reading reveals one of the many qualities of a mother: a comforter. But what exactly does that entail? What does it truly mean to be a comforter to our children? Webster’s dictionary defines comfort in two ways. The first explains that a comforter provides consolation, especially in times of loss or suffering. Many of us are familiar with this aspect of comfort. The second definition, my favorite, explains that a comforter provides hope and strength. Neither consoling or encouraging are easy tasks, yet as mothers we do so for our children time and time again—when they fall learning to ride a bike or as they navigate through relationships with friends or significant others. But like our children, we are mere humans. Life happens and there comes a time when even mothers become the ones in need of comfort. So what happens when the comforter needs comforting? In the Scripture reading, God promises to comfort you and me. He is our Comforter. We can look to Him in times of trouble for consolation and encouragement. In John 14:18 (KJV), Jesus promises that He will not leave us comfortless and so the Holy Spirit was given to us even for this purpose. The Greek word for comfort (parakletos) means “called to one’s side”. How great is it to know that God is on our side? Even as comforters we have our very own Comforter."," In times of tribulation, look to God as the source of your comfort and strength, recognizing that He is on your side to aid you.","“For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13)","Lord, comfort me in my time of need. Give me strength where I am weak."A REWARD FOR KINDNESS,5/14/18,"16 A kindhearted woman gains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth. 17 Those who are kind benefit themselves, but the cruel bring ruin on themselves. 18 A wicked person earns deceptive wages, but the one who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward. (Proverbs 11:16-18) ",Numbers 17,"Motherhood is wonderful. I think every mother would agree that there are rewards that come along with it, like seeing your children smile when you’re able to give them something they want and provide beyond their basic needs. I sometimes sit and watch my two young children play together. No television on. No phone in my hand or computer on my lap. I just sit and watch them laugh and play and it brings me such joy. Then there are times when I am really busy and it feels as if there is no time to sit and watch and be still. Sometimes I get stressed out and tired. I find that in the busy times, the stressful and tired times, that I’m a little less patient, a little quicker to anger, and sometimes even a little mean. Can you identify with my experience? Today’s verse is a good reminder that the woman who gains honor (or respect) is the one who is kind-hearted—in both the calm and busy times. We can infer then that an easy way to lose honor or respect is to be unkind. I’m sure we can agree that children learn from everything they see. So when they see us act unkind in difficult times, it teaches them that it’s okay for them to do so as well. The truth is that we should be kind at all times. Maybe you have experienced disrespectfulness lately, from your children or someone else. We should consider how our own words and actions might be contributing to such disrespect.", Reflect on how you treat your children and others in various situations. Focus on being kind-hearted even when it isn’t easy.," “For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13)",Prayer: Father uproot every unkindness in me. Help me to be kind at all times and to all people.SELF-MADE MOM,5/15/18,"“Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, casting all your cares upon Him, for He cares for you.” (1 Peter 5:6-7) ", Numbers 18,"Entering motherhood has been one of the most humbling experiences of my life. It has challenged me physically, spiritually, mentally, and definitely emotionally. In this (fairly) new season I have learned that I don’t “have it all together”, that I am still a work in progress. Not too long ago, it was very discouraging to me that I wasn’t a perfect mom. It felt like other moms around me had it figured out and I was still trying to learn to adjust to all my new responsibilities. I felt alone in how I was coping with entering into motherhood and alone in my duties as a mother. As I read the scripture reading for today, I realized I didn’t have to do things all by myself and trying to do so was an insult to God because I was trying to be self-reliant. Many pastors have shared with me that God created us to be dependent on God and interdependent on other humans. So, to humble ourselves under God means to dismiss self-reliance and replace it with a God-reliance, to be fully dependent on Him. You have heard there’s no such thing as a self-made millionaire. Well, there’s also no such thing as a selfmade mom. We can’t do it on our own because we’re not supposed to. We weren’t created that way. We must cast our cares on the Lord to be able to do the things He has called us to do. How great is it to know that though the responsibility is ours, we are His responsibility?",God did not entrust you with responsibility and walk away. He is always there for you so depend on Him because He cares.," “For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13)",Lord forgive me for trying to do things on my own. I recognize that I need you and ask that you help me with all I have to do.THE CYCLE OF FEAR,5/16/18,"“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.” (Joshua 1:9) ", Numbers 19,"God wants us to walk by faith, not by fear. Fear is a weapon of the devil. It is a tool used for our destruction. It is often used in combination with distraction, which is the first step in the cycle of fear. The devil distracts us from our relationship with God, such as through separating us from prayer. Paul tells us, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7 ESV). So the devil distracts us by convincing us we are too busy, too tired, and so forth to pray. The scripture tells us that peace is a protective covering for our minds, and by extension, our thoughts. So the devil is able to break down our protective peace covering by preventing us from going to God in prayer. This is the second step in the cycle of fear. The devil steals our peace. Once our peace is gone, our minds are now unprotected from the tricks of the devil. This leads to the third step in the cycle of fear: capture our sight. I’m not talking about our physical sight, but rather our mind and thoughts. When we stop praying (which we are commanded to do without ceasing), our focus is no longer on the God who is able, and the peace we have in knowing the power of the God we serve is lost. The devil knows that if he has your mind, he has your focus. “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you” (Philippians 4:8-9, ESV). The fourth and final cycle of fear is to control our actions. If the enemy has control of our focus (turning our eyes toward the problem and away from the problem-solver) then he can stifle the action God is calling us to take. One of these actions is prayer and so the cycle begins again. ",Ask yourself: What am I imagining? What am I envisioning with my mind? Where is my focus? Break the cycle of fear by continuously going to God in prayer and making your requests known to Him. ," “For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13) ","Lord, redirect my thoughts toward you and the promises of your word. Let your peace protect my mind and may the enemy never gain access again in the mighty name of Jesus"GOD-ESTEEM,5/17/18,"5 Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” 6 So we can confidently say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?” (Hebrews 13:56) ",Numbers 20,"The word that stands out to me in this passage is “confidently.” To have confidence in something or someone means that you have certainty and assurance that you can rely on that person or thing. As a child, and even into early adulthood, I struggled with very low self-esteem and, as a result, had a lot of doubt in myself and my capabilities. Simply put, I didn’t think I was worth much. I noticed that even after I accepted Christ as my Savior and gave my life to Him all of my problems did not cease. In fact, I carried the baggage of low self-esteem and self-doubt into my Christian identity. I still didn’t see myself the way God sees me, so I couldn’t confidently say that He was my Helper. I didn’t think I was worthy of His help. So often times I rejected it. But the good news is that God did not call us to be worthy, only to be willing. You have heard the phrase: God does not call the equipped, but He equips the called. So also, God does not call those worthy of His help, only those who are willing to receive it.","Put aside self-esteem for God-esteem. Stop waiting to be worthy, instead be willing to receive help from the Lord.","“For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13)"," Father help me to see myself the way you see me, as light and salt, and grant me the grace to accept you as my Helper. "ORDINARY HELP,5/18/18,"11Then the Lord said to Elijah, ‘Go, stand in front of Me on the mountain. I, the Lord, will pass by you.’ Then a very strong wind blew. The wind cause the mountains to break apart. It broke large rocks in front of the Lord. But that wind was not the Lord. After that wind, there was an earthquake. But that earthquake was not the Lord. After the earthquake, there was a fire. But that fire was not the Lord. After the fire, there was a quiet, gentle voice.” (I Kings 19:11-12) ", Numbers 21,"In the Christian community, we can sometimes get hung up on the miraculous works of God. We hear many sermons on the miracles Jesus performed and receive encouragement that we ourselves will experience our own miracles. I believe that we all will in Jesus’ name. Sometimes, however, we miss the ordinary ways God helps us because we are so focused on receiving a miracle. In the scripture reading, Elijah had just escaped from Jezebel who sought to kill him. At this time, Elijah was the only prophet of God left. Israel had forsaken God’s covenant yet again. So, in his prayer, Elijah was complaining to God about Israel and how he’s the only prophet of God left. He didn’t know what else to do—to the point that he asked God to take his life. I imagine Elijah must have been asking himself why is he in this situation? How did he get to this point? It would seem to any of us that Elijah needed a miracle, but God thought otherwise (Isaiah 55:9). Based on the scripture reading, God did not come in the form of wind, or earthquake, or fire, but He came as a quiet, gentle voice. In other words, God didn’t take extraordinary measures to answer Elijah’s prayer, He simply answered in the ordinary. The scripture goes on to tell us that Elijah heard the gentle voice of God. Can you hear His gentle voice? Does your desire for a miracle overpower your ability to see all the ways in which God works? ",Take time to reflect on the ordinary ways in which God works in your life.," “For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13)","Lord, I thank you for all the ways you help me. Teach me to see your ways more clearly."SILIENT HELP,5/19/18,"9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. 10 Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; 11 not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 12 rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer. (Romans 12:9-12) ",Numbers 22,"We live in a very fast-paced, instant, ready to-go society. We can order food online or in an app so that it’s already prepared when we get to the restaurant, so, no more waiting in lines during the lunch rush hour. We can skip adding items to our online shopping carts with 1-click ordering on Amazon. We can even ask Google or Alexa to define a word for us without having to take time looking it up in the dictionary. We have been spoiled to get things we want when we want them (or at least very soon afterwards). It’s no wonder we pray to God and expect an answer immediately. We’re so used to cutting out the waiting process in so many other areas of our lives that we try to do the same thing with prayer. We try to eliminate or at least reduce God’s response time in hopes of getting answers or help from God a little (or let’s be honest, a lot) faster. Yet there are benefits to waiting on God, such as teaching us that we need to depend on Him, developing patience (a fruit of the Spirit) in us, helping us to exercise faith, and teaching us to be still, even in a fast-paced world. When we try to eliminate the waiting process by taking matters into our own hands, we’re actually hurting ourselves because we no longer experience the benefits that come with waiting. So, God’s silence is not Him ignoring us, it’s actually another way He helps us before He answers our prayers."," As you wait on God, experience the help He is already offering."," “For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, ‘Fear not, I will help you.’” (Isaiah 41:13)"," God, help me to develop the fruit of patience as I wait on you. Help me to not mistake your silence for disregard."STRIVING FOR HOLINESS,5/20/18,"17 “Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? 18 But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them. 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts— murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. 20 These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.” (Matthew 15:17-20) ", Numbers 23,"God's nature is holy. He wants holiness in our lives and hearts. It is easy to project ""righteousness"", but God sees us for who we really are on the inside. We must inwardly cleanse ourselves because as Christians we are called to be holy and blameless (Ephesians 1:4), but we cannot be those things if we are constantly defiling ourselves by the way we think and speak. When we walk closely with God we will develop the fruit of the spirit but that can’t happen without a genuine conversion and transformation of the heart. Christ didn’t die to save us from sin alone, He came so that we might become holy. Although it’s a lifelong process there are few things we can do in our everyday lives that will aid us on our journey towards sanctification. We must make a conscious effort to pursue holiness. If we truly love God, we will commit to making holiness one of our many goals in life. Yielding to the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will reveal our sins, so we can recognize them and choose to turn away from them. It will also shine a light on scripture so that we can understand the meaning and how to apply it to our lives. There can’t be holiness without Obedience. Seek improvement, not perfection. At times we as Christians don’t strive towards holiness because it appears as an impossible standard. Our lack of perfection should push us to continually trust in God to meet His goal for us and to rely on his strength. We also must remember that God is the one who sanctifies us. And lastly, we as believers are to be holy not because we want to gain the love of Christ but because we already have love in Christ. We are loved because He loved us first and the best way to show that love is by striving to become holy, because He is holy."," There’s absolutely nothing we can do without God, so when faced with what seems like an impossible task ask him for the strength, ask him to teach you to do things his way. "," But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23) "," Lord, in everything that I do help me and teach me to be as holy as you are."BEWARE OF HYPOCRISY,5/21/18,"13 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. 15 “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are. (Matthew 23:13-15) ", Numbers 24,"The religious leaders during the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry, also known as the Pharisees, were obsessed with the law. They were well versed in the scripture and passionate about following every letter of the Law. However, in adhering to the law they searched for loopholes that would allow them to defy the spirit behind the law. Also, they showed no compassion toward their brethren and overly expressed their “spirituality” just to be praised by those around them. It was their hypocrisy that kept them from having genuine fellowship with God. Although Jesus never outright condemned them for their behavior, He did point out that ’justice and mercy and faithfulness.’ are more important than pursuing perfection. Jesus made it obvious that there wasn’t a problem with the law but with the way the Pharisees executed it. The Bible calls hypocrisy a sin, in which there are two forms, that of declaring belief in something and then acting contrary to that belief, and that of looking down on others when we ourselves are far from perfect. The word ‘hypocrite’ came into English from the Greek word ‘hypokrites’, which means “an actor” or “a stage player.” As followers of Christ we should be consistent with what we believe and who we claim to be in Christ. Acting is best left for the stage, not real life.",Think twice then act. Take a second and think about what you’re about to say or do and ask yourself if it’s something that contradicts who you say you believe in.," But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)"," Father let my life be a reflection of who you are, so that others may see you in me and draw close to you."OWNING YOUR PEACE,5/22/18," If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. (Romans 12:18) ",Numbers 25,"At some point in our lives we have dealt with someone who insists on making our lives extremely difficult. Such people carry a toxic character trait. Toxic people will blame everyone but themselves for their problems; they might even put the blame on you. As much as they may love to blame their pain on you, you have to realize it is not about you. They have issues that they don’t know how to deal with, so they lash out. The Bible says, “If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.” Notice how the verse say ‘IF” not ‘IT IS”. Sometimes in life it is not always possible to live at peace with everyone. There are just some people that no matter what you do they will always go out of their way to make everyone around them uncomfortable; no matter how nice you are to them they are still going to be mean to you. And the second part of that verse says, “as far it depends on you”. That means you must do your best to preserve peace. Don’t start fights. Don’t stir up trouble over things that aren’t even important. How do we live peaceably? Well, we can’t live a peaceful life unless we are at peace with God. Peace is found in salvation. Jesus is the only way to be at peace with God. He alone is the Prince of peace. Peace is not the absence of trouble, we have to constantly work at having peace in our hearts, which will in turn make our homes better; make the church better and society better.", It can be hard to be the “bigger” person but as Christians we have to turn the other cheek and keep things as peaceful as possible.,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)","Lord, teach me how to deal with difficult people and help me to bring peace into the life of those around me."THE POWER OF THE TONGUE,5/23/18," Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. (Ephesians 4:29) ", Numbers 26,"There is so much power in the tongue. Through the use of the tongue, nations can be set against nation; there can be war, famine, death and devastation. Through the tongue, there can be unity, fellowship, peace, and settlements of disputes. We can help and heal one another just as much as we can harm and hurt one another with the words we say. The tongue can be a great blessing if it is used in the way God ordained. The way we speak gives us away, it shows who we are and who we belong to; it shows what kind of person we are. In the world we live in today, unbelievers deliberately use words that cause fights and provoke those around them to anger. As Christians living among them we must be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath.  Obscene words, dirty jokes, slander, manipulative speech and irritating words must not come out of our lips, but only what will encourage, unite and edify those around us. ",Try saying something encouraging to the people around you more often and see how things change.,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)","Father, help me to grow in you so the words I say may be used to encourage and bless others."A LIFE OF WORSHIP,5/24/18,"""Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."" (1Thessalonians 5:16-18) ",Numbers 27,"God wants us to have an attitude of joy, gratitude and prayer at all times, no matter what we’re going through. The text isn’t saying we have to thank God for the bad things and tragedies that come our way in life. It is reminding us that we need to be joyful no matter what is happening because we have Christ, and in Him we can and will overcome any plans the enemy has against us. God doesn’t want us to thank Him for the bad things because he didn’t send them. He is not the creator of evil. We can’t let life’s circumstances make us bitter; we have to rejoice in the Lord. The devil is constantly scheming, one of his preferred schemes is to send something bad into the lives of God’s people and blame it on God. If the devil can get people to believe that the bad things they’re experiencing are happening because of God, it is easier to convince them that God has failed and forsaken them. The devil’s plan is to destroy our faith in God. However, we can overcome these lies of the enemy through prayer and worship. Our prayers should bring praise to His name. We should pray against the attacks of the enemy and ask God to give us the strength to make it through because we have faith that He will bring us out victoriously. Worship is more than music. There are innumerable ways to worship; anytime we give our attention to God is worship. Expressing our love and gratitude to God is worship. You don’t have to be in a church to worship God. Worshiping is moving your focus from your problems and things around you unto God."," Whenever you feel down by things happening around you, instead of allowing it to ruin your day use your time to thank God for what He’s done and what you believe He will do and give Him the praise He deserves.","But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)"," Dear God help me to always rejoice in you, no matter what I’m going through. Help me to stand strong in You and not get distracted by the lies of the enemy."PRAYING GOD’S WILL,5/25/18,"14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. (1 John 5:14-15) ", Numbers 28,"God answers prayers. But there may be times when we may feel as though our prayers are not being answered. There could be several reasons as to why our prayers aren’t being answered. When hardships come, God can sometimes use them as a wake-up call for people going astray. God hates pride and arrogance, but if we humble ourselves in prayer and seek his face and turn away from sin, then He will hear us and deliver us. God wants to answer our prayers; He is willing and ready. But our sins and unrighteousness form a barricade between us and our God. This calls for self-examination. The solution to our problems sometimes might not be breaking yokes or going to deliverance services. Sometimes the solution may be to genuinely repent from our sins. As Christians, our prayers need to be aligned with the will of God. The will of God is so broad, it covers every area of our lives – our happiness, healing, righteousness, etc. Everything we need and will ever need has been willed by God. Praying in accordance to His will doesn’t mean we get to pray for whatever we want and then throw “in Jesus’ name, amen” at the end, hoping that it automatically makes the prayer acceptable. We must pray for the things God wants us to pray about. The more we know about God through Scripture, the better we will have an understanding of how to pray. ",Search your Bible for the promises God has made you and use them when you pray.,"  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)","Lord, forgive me for my sins and don’t allow them to be a hindrance to my prayers. Let your will be done in my life."GODLY LOVE,5/26/18," “A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another (John 13: 34- 35). ",Numbers 29,"God is love. The purest and truest form of love comes from God; when we love God, we are able to truly love others. We are only able to love others because He loved us first. We were all made in the image of God; He made us to be like Him. As children of God we should be like our Father, so if God is joy, peace, kind, good, faithful, and gentle, then our lives should be a reflection of that. If God is love our lives should reflect that love. When we love ourselves or anything else more than God, love becomes unhealthy and distorted. We begin to define love as whatever we want it to mean. But God loves us so much that He paid the ultimate price and gave us a true example of what love is by sacrificing His only Son, so we can live and have eternal life. This alone should be reason enough to love God. How we love others, especially as Christians, reveals how we love God. Our love for each other is an indication of the place God has in our hearts. In John 13:34, Jesus says “I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other”. This command is important to Christ, so maybe the best thing we can do is take an honest look at the way we love others"," Sometimes it’s not what you say, it’s how you say it. You can get a better response from someone if you say things with love"," But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. (Galatians 5:22-23)","Lord, I pray that you will teach me to love You with all my heart so that I may love others unconditionally as you love me."WONDER OF WONDERS,5/27/18,"“22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. 23 After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, 24 and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. 25 Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. 26 When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear. 27 But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”28 “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.”29 “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. 30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” 31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” (Matthew 14:22-31) ",Numbers 30,"In this passage, Jesus was walking on the lake. The disciples saw Him and were terrified. They thought He was a ghost. He immediately calmed their fears by identifying Himself. Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, if it is really You, tell me to come to You by walking on water.” Jesus said, “All right, come.” Sometimes in life, God will tell us to take a leap of faith. He will even identify Himself as the One leading us. We might even listen and take a step or two out of our comfort zones. However, when we look at the situation through human eyes or listen to the opinion of others, we might falter in following Him. This was the situation with Peter in this passage when Jesus asked him to walk on water. He did it until he looked around him and saw the wind. How many times has Jesus reached out to us asking us to come to Him, give up our current way of life and follow Him? How many times have we “given our lives to God” and said the “sinner’s” prayer only to go back to our old ways after we count the cost of following Christ? How many times have we looked at the Christian journey and given up before we even started? Just like this Bible story, we can only be successful if we keep our eyes on Our Lord and Savior. On our own accord, we cannot be successful on our Christian journey. Jesus is the only One that can help us live a victorious Christian life. When He fills us with His spirit, we can “walk on water” too. We can experience God in unusual ways and grow strong in our faith. Today, I dare you to trust the Master completely in your Christian journey. He will not fail you if you trust Him", Do not be afraid to follow His leading once you are sure He is the one speaking. He will help you to fulfill your calling by His great power that is at work within you. ,"“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27) "," Lord, help me to hear when you call me. Let me follow you wholeheartedly without fear when you call me."GONE FISHING,5/28/18,"One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,[a] the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. 2 He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. 3 He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”5 Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”6 When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. 7 So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!”  (Luke 5:1-8) ", Numbers 31,"In life, it is often easy for us to go our own way, after all God gave each of us a measure of wisdom and free will. I remember as a child growing up, I always had my own way of doing things that was different from others. Sometimes, I was disobedient and followed my own way, only to realize the extent of my folly later on when situations got out of my control or I was chastised. In this chapter, Simon was an experienced fisherman. He knew how to fish. His livelihood depended on the fishes he caught. He had worked all night without catching anything. He could have been easily frustrated on such a day. Despite the angst of the day, He listened when Jesus made a request to use his boat. Can you imagine at the end of a long day, having to “waste time” with a stranger when you just want to get home? After Jesus had taken His time to teach from Simon’s boat, He asked him to let down his fishing nets, although his nets were already being cleaned at the end of a long night. Despite the situation, he obeyed Jesus and his life was never the same. In life, we don’t know where or when we will encounter God. It could be on a weary day like Simon did. Because of Simon’s obedience, he experienced God in an unusual way and his life was never the same. Are you like Simon who was willing to obey God despite the odds? Are you a “know it all”? Or are you “too experienced” or “set in your ways” to allow God to work in you and through you? God is able to do more than we think or imagine in our lives, if we allow Him. "," Be mindful to listen to God always. Do not always rely on your experience, instead trust in God who is able to do all things.","“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)"," Lord, sensitize me to the time and season around me. Help me not to miss my destiny and purpose in my due time and season."A POWERFUL WORD,5/29/18,"46 Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. 47 When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.48 “Unless you people see signs and wonders,” Jesus told him, “you will never believe.”49 The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”50 “Go,” Jesus replied, “your son will live.”The man took Jesus at his word and departed. 51 While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. 52 When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.”53 Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” So he and his whole household believed. (Luke 5:46-53) ", Numbers 32,"I remember attending a church service last year. During the service, the preacher prophesied that many people would be healed at the service because the power of healing was available, if they believed. He asked anyone who needed healing to ask God for it. I believed the word and was healed of migraines. No one touched me or laid hands on me. I was simply healed because of my faith in God. Many times, we have ailments and we expect ministers of God to lay hands on us before we receive our healing.  It is acceptable to ask them to pray with us, after all the Bible supports it. However, we must realize that God uses His ministers as conduits to release His power. He may choose to heal us anyway He sees fit. The important thing to recognize is that God is the source of our healing. In the story in this passage, Jesus did not lay His hands on the sick son. He did not even visit the house the sick boy was staying in. He simply said a word and the father believed. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe the Word of God that is released, and we will see God move mightily in any area of life we need him to move. I urge you to pray and believe Him today for all your needs, including healing.","Declare today that you will trust God to heal you and help you accomplish all things you need in your life, according to His will.","“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)"," Lord, help me to believe your word. Help me not to doubt Your ability to do all things in my life."COLLAPSED WALL,5/30/18,"1Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. 2 Then the LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. 3 March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. 4 Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. 5 When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in. (Joshua 6:1-5) ", Numbers 33,"Our God is a God of wonders. I once heard a testimony about a “barren” woman who carried a baby to term without a womb. As I stood listening to the testimony, I was in awe of God because it did not fit the normal pattern of conception. Everyone knows a baby needs a womb to develop. Yet the bouncing baby boy held in the mother’s arms testified to the surreal reality. Similarly, in the story in this passage, it seemed impossible that a loud shout after priests blow their trumpets is all that is needed to break down the fortified wall of a city. The Israelites must have been intimated when God commanded them to head for Jericho. Jericho was a trade metropolis and the oldest walled city in the world at the time. Expecting the city’s walls to collapse after marching around the city for six days, and then waiting until the seventh day before making any move seems like a joke. God did not go through the normal or expected channel, although there were armed men with weapons of war in the group. God could be preparing to deliver your miracle to you. It may come in an unusual way or form; you just have to be open to receive from God, no matter the way He chooses to deliver your breakthrough. Are you open to receiving from God today? "," Determine in your heart today to be open to God’s miracles, however He plans to accomplish it. Live in expectation of receiving God’s blessing. ","“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)"," Lord, let me experience your wonder-working power in my life. Grant me testimonies that will change the faith of others that hear it."MIGHTY IN BATTLE,5/31/18,"10 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD. 11 They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 12 Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”13 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. 14 The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”15 Then the LORD said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. 16 Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground. 17 I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen. 18 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.” (Exodus 14: 10-18) ",Numbers 34,"I remember being bullied as a child in boarding school in Nigeria. The bully was a year ahead of me in school. She would assign me different punishments for things I did innocently but would claim that they were against school regulations. I remember the day my sister, who was a senior, had “a talk” with her regarding her attitude towards me. She apologized immediately and left me alone once she realized I had someone older and higher in school grade than her, defending me. As Christians, God is our best defense against any contrary power. In this story, the Israelites saw their enemies. These were not “imagined” enemies, but rather real enemies. They saw the enemy and quaked in their shoes at the ferociousness of the enemy. They forgot that the Lord who allowed Pharaoh to let them go in the first place was still on His throne. Despite their fears, God proved Himself mighty to them once again. Indeed, God hardened the hearts of the Egyptians even further and it led to the destruction of their enemies. Sometimes, we will find ourselves in situations where we ask ourselves, “who will fight for us”? Don’t ever forget that the Lord, the maker of Heaven and Earth, the Commander in Chief of Heaven’s armies is on your side. The Lord who has never lost a battle is the one on your side. You can be rest assured that because you have accepted Jesus, you are on the winning side!", Trust God to fight for you; be confident in Him and know that He is the ultimate Deliverer who can save you.," “I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27) ","Fight my battles, O Lord. Give me victory in every battle and challenges facing my life.  Let my enemies make self-destructing mistakes like the armies of Pharaoh."A HANDFUL OF FLOUR AND A LITTLE OLIVE OIL,6/1/18,"12 “As surely as the LORD your God lives,” she replied, “I don’t have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. 14 For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD sends rain on the land.’” (1 Kings 17:12-14) ",Numbers 35,"I am always amazed when I read this Bible story. I often ask myself why God sent Prophet Elijah to the widow of Zarephath. Why didn’t He send Elijah to a rich man, a king or someone with a lot of money? The prophet Elijah had not been living well since hiding from King Ahab. God told him to go to Zarephath. Prior to going to Zarephath, his meals were provided miraculously by ravens. One would think that when he left his current situation, it would be to a muchimproved status. However, God sent him to a poor widow. Not just any widow but one who had lost all hope. The widow was going to make a meal for herself and her son so that they may eat and die. Our God has a sense of humor. He used the need of prophet Elijah to save the widow and her son. Because the widow obeyed the prophet, she experienced divine provision. Sometimes, we might have to give out of our great need to a cause God is compelling us to support. Other times we might have to pay our tithe and offering while knowing we don’t have enough money to pay the rest of our monthly bills. Our God is a great provider. He knows our needs and He will provide for us accordingly. The Lord who used five loaves of bread and two fishes to feed a multitude, the God who fed prophet Elijah through ravens and the Savior who saved the widow of Zarephath and her son from death is able to supply all your needs today. Won’t you trust Him? He will cause all things to work together for your good."," Be faithful in giving to the kingdom of God through your tithes and offering, as commanded in the Bible. As you obey God, depend on Him to meet your monetary and non-monetary needs. "," “I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)","Lord, I come before you today with all my needs. I pray that you will provide for all my needs according to your riches in glory through Christ Jesus."THE LORD THAT ANSWERS BY FIRE,6/2/18,"20 So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. 21 Elijah went before the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.”But the people said nothing. 22 Then Elijah said to them, “I am the only one of the LORD’s prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. 23 Get two bulls for us. Let Baal’s prophets choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. 24 Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire—he is God.”Then all the people said, “What you say is good.” (1 King 18: 20-24)",Numbers 36,"I remember when I was trying to make a career choice. I considered different careers in the healthcare field. I thought about the pros and cons of different careers. I also thought about the income and lifestyle I wanted for my future. In the end, I went with the career I had the best aptitude for and felt God was leading me to choose. Ahab, son of Omri, a king in Israel did more evil in the Lord’s sight than any of the kings before him. He did more to arouse God’s anger than any of the other kings of Israel. He also married Jezebel, began to worship Baal and set up a temple and altar for Baal. In this story, Elijah asked the people to make a choice. Follow God, their maker, or follow Baal. He tried to convince them of the invincibility of the Lord God over Baal. Elijah prepared a bull and laid it on a wooden altar. The prophets of Baal did the same. Elijah dug a water-filled trench around the altar and called on the Lord to prove His supremacy over Baal. Of course, God reigned supreme. You might be asking yourself the same questions. Which gods or God should I serve? There are many religions today, but the right choice is obvious. The Bible is clear on this topic. Jesus is the way, the truth and life. He is our only access to God. Accept Him today.",Pray to God to continue to reveal Himself to you and remove every doubt that the enemy brings to your mind,"“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)","Lord, reveal yourself to me. In any way I have doubts about your supremacy, convince me and help me to trust you more."FORGIVENESS IS FOR YOU,6/3/18,"31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. 32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. (Ephesians 4:31 - 32) ",Deuteronomy 1,"When we choose to forgive someone, we’re wiping the slate clean, pardoning them and letting go of the desire to enact vengeance. There are times when we don’t want to forgive people who have wronged us, but not forgiving others makes us bitter and angry. By forgiving others we free ourselves emotionally and spiritually. We can use forgiveness as a way of showing God that we trust Him to heal us emotionally. Letting go of anger and hurt can help keep you calm and even improve your health, but most importantly forgiving others is a way to receive God’s forgiveness for our own sins. 
As we forgive those who have wronged us we also have to remember that forgiveness is not a free pass for others to take advantage of us. Forgiveness does not condone the offense nor does it mean that the offense never happened; it’s simply letting it go. Even though you’re not excusing the offense you can choose to not be consumed by the anger and hurt. We have to trust God to avenge us and remember that there will come a time when we will no longer feel the pain so deeply. We ourselves aren’t perfect so we should be empathetic. Just like we’d like to be forgiven, we should forgive others for their mistakes as well. ", Remember that forgiveness is more beneficial for you and Jesus you to forgive all the time no matter how many times you’ve been wronged. ," Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all. (1 Chronicles 29:12)","Dear God, help me to forgive those who have wronged me regardless of my feelings. I’m letting this go and I set myself free for your healing. Thank you for forgiving me as I have forgiven them. Amen"THE MOTIVE TO GIVE,6/4/18,"7 Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. (2 Corinthians 9:7) ", Deuteronomy 2,"When it comes to giving, motivation is everything. There are many wrong motives for giving.  We are always told “Give, and it will be given to you…” this scripture in Luke 6:38 is often used to motivate people to give, but Jesus is not promising us that if we give we will receive more in return. Giving to get is the wrong motivation. Jesus wants us to be generous givers because the giver is more blessed than those who receive.  He may not bless you financially for your offerings, but he might give you an unexpected gift, a new car or good health.  Another wrong reason to give is so we can be praised and honored by men. Giving should be an act done in secret before God (Matt 6:4). With that being said, we should give because God has given to us. He gave us is Son, He has blessed us spiritually, everything we have was given to us by Him and He always provides for us. God has blessed us abundantly so we should give back to Him generously and cheerfully. But God cares about our attitude of giving as well as what we give. Giving also helps us to be compassionate people. Our lives today require so much, there are so many needs that have to be fulfilled. It can be easier to focus on ourselves and not give at all. It’s not possible to help every person in need all around the world but we should do all we can to show compassion in the name of Christ. Giving teaches us to find our security in God and to rely on Him for our needs. If you give, God promises to supply your needs.","The definition of ‘Give’ is “to freely transfer the possession of (something) to (someone)”. So if God has so freely given us everything we have, we should have no problem showing our gratitude to Him by giving back."," Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all. (1 Chronicles 29:12)",Lord I thank you for all that you have given to me. I pray that you will give me a heart that loves to give and serve others with what you have so graciously given to me. AmenBENEFITS OF A HUMBLE LIFE,6/5/18,"6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, 7 casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. (1 Peter 5:6-7) "," Deuteronomy 3
","Humility is essential to our growth as believers.  We can’t truly make spiritual progress until we fully understand who we are in Christ.  God is Holy and we are sinners in need of His grace. If we remember this it will help our walk with Christ and in the way we treat others. As humans humility doesn’t come easily. Our flesh craves the confidence that comes from pride. The world is constantly telling us to put ourselves first and the enemy wants nothing more for us than to fall into a world of arrogance and pride. Thankfully there are some things we can do to keep ourselves in check. Reading and actually studying the Bible reminds us that God is holy and we are not. The beginning of humility is seeing God for who He is and seeking the forgiveness that only He can give. The Bible is filled with messages that give us the hope that only the Gospel brings. We have to make time to study, meditate and memorize the Bible. We must also learn how important our local church is to our walk with Christ, especially since there are so many commandments in the Bible we can’t obey unless we are a part of a local body. Serving others in our local church can help us grow in humility. If you chose to work in the nursery, help feed the homeless or simply listening to a fellow believer share their hardships, it’s going to help you to think outside of yourself. Helping others is a reminder that we aren’t the center of the universe and we weren’t created to live for ourselves. We should also make time for prayer.  The Bible commands us to humble ourselves and cast our worries and anxieties on Him. When we pray we are acknowledging that God is God, we are asking Him for what we don’t have on our own and for what only He can give. ",Take time out of your busy schedule to help and or encourage someone in need. ,"Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all.  (1 Chronicles 29:12)"," Lord. I want my walk with you to grow stronger every day. Take pride away from me, I want to live a humble life that is pleasing to you. Amen"KNOWING YOUR WORTH ,6/6/18,"10 Moses said to the Lord, “Pardon your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.” 11 The Lord said to him, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the Lord? 12 Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.” (Exodus 4:10-11) ", Deuteronomy 4,"Our human nature tends to make us put on a façade, causing us to show a perfectly put together picture of ourselves to the rest of the world. We are all tempted to hide our feelings of not feeling like we’re enough. It can be extremely tiring to keep up this façade, but I want you to know that because of Jesus Christ, you are enough, you are valuable. Ask yourself, is the way you view yourself based on how the world sees you or do you see yourself through the eyes of God according to His Word? Every time you feel like you’re not beautiful enough, you’re not successful enough, you’re not cool enough and etc., you’re basically contradicting the fact that you are fearfully and wonderfully made. Who are you to say that what God has created isn’t good or isn’t up to par? You can never forget that you were made in the image of God; He knew exactly what He was doing when He created you in your mother’s womb. The Bible has many examples of people who we would consider today as having low self-esteem. Moses is a great example.  When God came to him in the burning bush, Moses came up with so many excuses and questions before he finally admitted the cause of his fear and trepidation: “I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.” God didn’t respond by throwing compliments and telling Moses’ not to think of himself that way, He didn’t point out all of Moses’ positive attributes to get him to overlook the negative, like the world tends to do. Instead God points to Himself and says “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Who gives them sight or makes them blind? Is it not I, the Lord?  Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”  Remembering our worth comes from Christ can be an ongoing struggle but, the promise that God will be with us and help us should be all we need"," Whenever the enemy tries to discourage you and bring up thoughts of self-doubt, remember that God made you and He has called everything He created good","Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all. (1 Chronicles 29:12) ","Thank you Lord for loving me and calling me your own. I pray that no matter where I go or what I do, You will help me to remember that you will always help me and teach me."SURRENDERING CONTROL,6/7/18,"5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; 6 in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths. (Proverbs 3:5-6) ", Deuteronomy 5,"This is a very popular verse and we as Christians love to quote it, but when we find ourselves struggling we tend to forget this particular scripture. God is telling us not to rely on our own understanding. We are supposed to let go and let God handle it. He knows exactly what He is doing, and as believers we should be able to trust Him no matter the situation. If God can resurrect Lazarus from death, He can do the same for your situation if just you let go and trust Him. When you’re used to being in control it can be quite hard to let some things go, but when you understand how much God cares about you, you will have no problem letting go because you know He’s more than capable. After you have surrendered your control to God and prayed, you can be at peace and know that everything will work out for your good. We may not fully comprehend what or why some things happen to us, but we can be confident that in some way, shape or form God is changing things in our favor. As Christians we are truly blessed. We pray to our Heavenly Father, and because He loves us He won’t withhold any good thing from us. Even if it doesn’t seem to be the case at the time we should just let go and let God.  Think back, aren’t there some situations or people that you’re glad God delivered you from, even though it hurt for some time? Trust that God sees past the present and is looking at the big picture of your life and knows what’s best for you.",Take some time to reflect on the areas of your life that you need to surrender to God’s control. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you lean on Him regarding those areas,"Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all. (1 Chronicles 29:12)",Father help me to let go of things that are out of my control. Help me to trust in you at all times and have faith that you know what’s best for me.GUILT-FREE SALVATION,6/8/18,"16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. (John 3: 16-18)", Deuteronomy 6,"We all have sinned, and one of the products of sin is guilt. Feeling guilty for the sins we’ve committed isn’t necessarily bad, because it draws us closer to God by asking for forgiveness. When a person turns from sin and repents, their sin is immediately forgiven. Sometimes as believers it can be hard to get rid of the feeling of guilt, we know we’re saved but we still feel a lot of guilt from the choices we made in the past. The devil uses our guilt against us; he wants our guilt to stop us from growing in Christ. The good news is that God sent his Son to die for our sins and He will never condemn us for them. Our sins have been paid for in full on the Cross. Every sin we have and ever will commit has been covered by the grace of Christ Jesus. God wants us to be obedient and live righteously, but He doesn’t use guilt to get us to comply, He uses a loving hand, but that love requires discipline. Though sometimes we will suffer the consequence of our sins, God didn’t send His Son to earth to bring condemnation, He was sent to bring salvation to those who choose to believe in Him."," As soon as you repent from your sins God has forgiven and forgotten them, there’s no need to keep dwelling on the past and feeling guilty for your sins. "," Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all. (1 Chronicles 29:12)",Thank you Lord for sending your Son to die for me. Thank you for remembering my sins no more. Help me to move on and forgive myself just like you have forgiven me. Amen.KNOW GOD AND STAY WITH HIM,6/9/18,"8 But then, indeed, when you did not know God, you served those which by nature are not gods. 9 But now after you have known God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which you desire again to be in bondage? (Galatians 4:8-9) ",Deuteronomy 7 ,"We can agree that God knows us, but how does one get to know God? This is something many people have been trying to understand for thousands of years. Has anybody ever seen God? Is it possible to really know Him? The scripture says in John 1:18 that, “No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made Him known.” Jesus Christ is our connection to the Father. The only way to truly know God is to know Christ. Jesus Christ is the One who holds the key. The life of Jesus is no secret, the world knows of His teachings, but the most important thing is to know of His death and resurrection. Understanding what took place on the Cross is essential to knowing the character of God. On the Cross, Christ endured the punishment that we deserved. God cared for us so much that He didn’t have to think twice about sacrificing Jesus Christ. On the Cross is also where God shows us that He wants us to accept Jesus, because that is the only way into Heaven. What was done on the Cross is also a display of the miraculous power of God, the power of resurrection, which is within us.  Once we have come to know God, we should not move away from Him. We are no longer slaves to the world and cannot afford to be trapped by the enemy. That same resurrection power is alive today. James 4:7 says, “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” The devil has no choice and has already been defeated. Once we know the goodness of God, there is no reason to be anywhere else.","As you get to know Christ more, don’t keep Him to yourself, share your knowledge of Him with others."," Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything. Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all. (1 Chronicles 29:12)"," Oh Lord, reveal yourself to me like never before. Strengthen me so that I may continuously resist the enemy."GOD HEARS YOUR PRAYER,6/10/18,"19 People of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. (Isaiah 30:19) ",Deuteronomy 8,"God always wants us to come to Him in prayer. God is a loving Father who wants to give us the things we ask for, if and when we need them. There are times that we pray and we do not get the answer right away or we do not get what we have asked for. We must understand that God knows exactly what is best for us and He answers us when we pray with the right motives. The Bible says, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures” (James 4:3). If you are praying for God to bless you with something, it is possible that this is one of the reasons your prayer is not being answered right away. The Bible also tells us that God answers the prayers of the people that trust in Him. (1 Chronicles 5:20) 
We must have faith and believe that God can and will answer our prayers. We are to trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our own understanding (Proverbs 3:5). It means we are to put everything in the Lord’s hands. When you sit down in a chair, you put all your weight on it because you have faith and trust that it will support you. We need to trust God in the same way. Prayer is how we develop and strengthen our relationship with God. If you never spend time or discuss anything with your biological father here on earth, what type of relationship will you have with him? So is our Father in Heaven. He wants us to spend personal time with Him. The more time we spend with God, the closer we are to Him, and the more we will see that God hears our prayers. ",Pray with the mind of building up the Kingdom of God.," “And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)"," Lord, direct my heart to go after the things You desire for my life"A HUMBLE PRAYER,6/11/18,"12 Then he said to me, “Do not fear, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard; and I have come because of your words. (Daniel 10:12) ", Deuteronomy 9,"When you ask someone to tell you something about Daniel, most will tell you that he’s the one who was thrown into a den of lions for serving God. Daniel was a servant of God and would not allow any man or any law to hinder that. Daniel’s intimate relationship with God was much more important to him than his well-being. Daniel was not worried about his safety and was not going to turn his back on God. Because of Daniel’s close relationship with God, he was very aware of what was going on in the spiritual realm. Daniel was able to clearly understand what God was saying to him through dreams and visions. Daniel was not only a man that could hear God, but he was a man that could pray. Through reading about Daniel’s prayer life, we can see that he understood this level of authority. 
In today’s Scripture, we see that Daniel’s prayer was answered because he humbled himself before God. When we become proud, we begin to think that we are operating in our own power. The truth is that we can’t do anything without the grace of God. When we humble ourselves before God, we acknowledge the fact that He is the One that gives us all power and authority. James 4:6 says, “But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
We need to understand that pride can be a hindrance to answers to our prayers. If there is an obstruction in our prayer life, there will be a problem in every other area of our lives. Humble yourself. Humility will help you unlock the door to open Heavens. ", Recognize that God is your Source of power. Pray against the spirit of pride.,"“And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)"," Lord, help me to humble myself in the same way that Daniel did"SEEK GOD THROUGH PRAYER AND FASTING,6/12/18,"3 Then I set my face toward the Lord God to make request by prayer and supplications, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. (Daniel 9:3) ", Deuteronomy 10 ,"Even though Daniel lived in a dark and ungodly world that was filled with idolatry, he was still able to live a godly life. Because of the way Daniel sought after the Lord, the favor of God was upon him. The Bible tells us in Daniel 6, that three times a day, Daniel would pray to God. Daniel not only prayed, but he denied himself by fasting. Daniel was a faithful and obedient servant, who continuously sought the face of God. 
Jesus said that we should seek after the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. We are not supposed to just sit back, put our feet up, and allow things to happen to us. We are to take action and go after God. Seeking after God means that we set our hearts and our minds on Him and the things of His Kingdom. This is something that can be done through prayer and fasting. When we faithfully seek after God, we will find Him. When we find God, He will bless and reward us - the same way He did for Daniel.  Through that type of connection with the Father, anything is possible. It does not matter what type of miracle we need from God, He can do it. The Bible says, “But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6)
The greatest reward lies in knowing God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit. When we have that reward, we have everything. ",Continue to seek the face of the Lord through prayer and fasting,"“And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)"," Lord, give me the desire to continuously seek You."A PRAYER FOR DELIVERANCE,6/13/18,"I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined to me, and heard my cry. 2 He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps. 3 He has put a new song in my mouth— Praise to our God; many will see it and fear, and will trust in the LORD. (Psalm 40:1-3) ",Deuteronomy 11,"Christ came into the world as a deliverer to rescue us from the dark pit of sinfulness. Many times when we need deliverance, we are not as patient as we should be. When we are going through hard times, it is normal for us to pray and ask God to do what we want and when we want it. When there is a crucial need in our lives, it can seem as if God does not hear us. We cannot treat God like a pizza delivery man and our prayers like the order. Something we need to know about Satan is that he will do whatever he can to make things impossible for us. It is the enemy’s plan for Christians to lose faith in God, but we must never give up. With Christ, we have more than enough to overcome any opposition. He is always for us, not against us. 
In Romans 8:31-39, Paul wrote about how those who are in Christ are more than conquerors. Jesus Christ did not only die for us, He is also interceding for us. This is illustrated in this passage in Romans, “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Romans 8:31). It doesn’t matter what type of opposition we face, or what type of pit we find ourselves in, because of the love of God, there is always a way out. Nothing will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ. Christ is our Deliverer, but we must be patient. Our prayers will be answered according to God’s will for our lives. The hand of God will deliver us once and for all, we will be lifted out of the pit, and our feet shall be placed on solid ground.",Extend a hand to someone who might be in some type of pit or is hurting. Pray for them. ," “And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)","Lord, pull me out of any pit of sin. Heal my body of any pain or affliction."WE NEED THE RIGHT PERSPECTIVE,6/14/18,"Seek the LORD while He may be found, call upon Him while He is near. 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, and He will have mercy on him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. 8 “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” says the LORD. 9 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.  (Isaiah 55:6-9) ", Deuteronomy 12 ,"One of the most important things to know as children of God is His will for our lives. We know that if we seek after God, we will find Him. Finding God is important because we need God to direct our paths. If we are not close to God, how will He show us the correct route to take in life? 
When it comes to knowing God’s will, there is the reality that whatever it is we want for ourselves may not be what God wants for us. We do not think or reason like God, therefore we cannot naturally see beyond what is here and now. We can’t even be 100% sure about what will happen a few minutes from now, unlike our Father in Heaven. We need to have the right perspective. Many times we don’t see ourselves and the people surrounding us the way God wants us to. Instead of focusing on the things we want for ourselves, we should try to focus on what is best for the Kingdom of God. Instead of always praying for what we want, we should try praying for God’s will concerning His Kingdom. 
It is all about having the right perspective. God’s vision is perfect. God can see everything that is going on in our lives, in our homes, in the church, and the rest of the world. God, who is the Alpha and Omega, can see everything past, present and future at all times. Also, because He is a good God, the path He has for us is always the best path. ", Ask the Spirit of God to lead you to pray with the right perspective. ," “And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)","Lord, I want Your will to be done concerning my life. Make my heart a clean slate and direct my paths. "GLORIFY GOD IN PRAYER,6/15/18,"27 “Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’? But for this purpose I came to this hour. 28 Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.” (John 12:27-28) ", Deuteronomy 13,"Jesus always knew His purpose here on earth. The main focus in the mind of Jesus was glorifying His Father. This should teach us that when times are hard, we cannot forget to praise and glorify God through prayer. 
We must glorify God not only through prayer, but also in how we act, how we think, and how we treat others. To glorify God means to lift Him up and bring Him honor. We have to recognize how amazing God is before anything else. We can glorify God with our time. We can glorify God with our faith. There are many ways to glorify Him. We were all created for the glory of God, and Jesus knew that. ""Everyone who is called by My name, whom I have created for My glory; I have formed him, yes, I have made him."" (Isaiah 43:7).
We were all created for God's glory. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, you were created for the glory of God. One of the ways we can glorify God is by telling others about His goodness. We are instruments that God wants to use and we should allow Him to do so. Simply obeying the instructions we have received from God is another way of glorifying Him. Let your life glorify God in all that you do",Take yourself out of the daily routine of prayer. Push your needs to the side and spend extra time honoring God for who He is. ,"“And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)"," Lord, I give You all the glory. Father, I acknowledge that you are a good God and I give You all the praise."GOD WILL ANSWER,6/16/18,"Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the fish’s belly. 2 And he said: “I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction, and He answered me. “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and You heard my voice. (Jonah 2:1-2)", Deuteronomy 14,"My mother always said to me that God only helps the people that help themselves. That reminds me of what the Scripture says about faith without works being dead. We can have a great amount of faith and believe that God is going to do something for us, but there has to be an action behind that faith. I can pray as much as I want about doing well on a big exam, but if I don’t help myself by studying and reviewing the material for the exam, I probably will not do too well. Many times when we have already performed poorly, that is when we want God to help us. We need to obey God before He allows us to be swallowed by a big fish, just like Jonah.
Jonah is like the student who puts themselves in a bad situation by not studying or listening to the given instructions. When Jonah found himself in trouble, he called on God for help. If he had just done what God had told him to do initially, he wouldn’t have been swallowed by the fish. Like Jonah, we serve a God that will answer our prayers no matter how bad things have gotten for us. It doesn’t matter how bad we have messed up or how angry we think God is, He is always waiting on us to speak to Him. Unlike the relationships we have with human beings, God is always there for us. He will never tell us that it’s a bad time and to call Him back, God is always there. He might not give us the answer that we are looking for, but He always has the best answer for us.", Be obedient when following the instructions God has given you. ,"“And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)","Father, thank you for always being there for me. Thank you for answering my prayers. ""BECAUSE HE LIVES, I CAN FACE TOMORROW ",6/17/18,"22A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, but the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous (Proverbs 13:22 )",Deuteronomy 15,"We wish all the fathers a Happy Fathers’ Day. We thank you for all that you do and the sacrifices that you make for your families. I want to specially thank the Father of all fathers, our heavenly Father, for being there for us and never leaving us nor forsaking us throughout this journey of life. It is a special privilege to be His child and not to be taken for granted. It was love that made God, the Father, to sacrifice His only son in order to reconcile you and I to Himself so that we would not be lost forever to Him in eternity. What a great daddy! Earthly fathers strive to leave good legacies for their children. Some fathers leave great fortune, riches, good name, Ivy League education, wisdom, good genes, etc. in order to secure the future generation. While these are worthy things that improve quality of life, they don’t save lives. It will not secure eternity for their children. God, our heavenly father, our example, thought ahead of time. He did not only think of now but the future. He reconciled us to Himself through Jesus, the Son, the mediator of the new covenant. After the reconciliation, he gave us His spirit, the Holy Spirit, to journey with us through life and finally, He secured our eternity where we will live with Him forever. What a good Daddy! He thought of everything. He did not leave anything to chance where we are concerned. As fathers, our heavenly Father is the one to emulate. Regardless of how our own parents have lived, we have the obligation to teach our children the way of God. We can work hard and leave worldly fortunes and inheritance for the next generation as the bible advises in the book of Proverbs that a good man leaves inheritance for his childrens’ children.  However, we should not forget the most important inheritance, a relationship with God, our Maker. This is a legacy worth leaving behind because it transcends this life and is a gift that we can leave for our childrens’ children. Wealth and fortunes can be squandered, good names dragged through the mud with bad behavior, but a relationship with God is personal and will change any future for the better if given. Strive to teach your children about their heavenly Father today. Take the time to train your children in the way of God. Let them grow in their relationship with God under your guidance and example. It will change the course of your family and impact future generations. ", Commit to leaving a legacy of faith for the next generation. ," “LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken” (Psalm 16:5-8) "," Lord, enable me to leave a legacy of following Christ for my children and generations to come."A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ,6/18/18,"14 For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,[c] 15 from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height— 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God  (Ephesians 3: 14-19 ). ", Deuteronomy 16,"As human beings in this current age, we want the best, fastest, latest, and current things. One example is electronical gadgets. I might not buy the latest version but I don’t want it to be too dated because I know in a few months to years, there will be another more updated version. The bible in the book of Proverbs says that as a man thinks in his heart so is He. If we have this thought process in our secular life, it is very likely that we apply it to our spiritual life as well. Most people think that the Christian God is an outdated God who has rigid rules and regulations. Others see God as a task master from yesteryears who is not “current” and does not understand the challenges of living in this day and age. We want to fit God in a box. We forget that God created the universe and everything in it. He knows the beginning and the end of all things. He was there in the beginning through the creation of man in the garden of Eden. He understands evolution even better than us. For example, He was there from the days of camels to horse-drawn buggies to automobiles to planes to space shuttles, etc. He knows how everything starts and how it will end. God is bigger and better than our understanding of Him. He is bigger than the biggest, stronger than the strongest, wiser than the wisest of men. Let us pray that God will open our eyes to see Him as He truly is; the Almighty, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Only Wise, All Sufficient, and Totally Capable God. When Peter, James and John saw Jesus transformed in their eyes on the Mount of Transfiguration, Peter said, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters – one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, they heard a voice from the cloud that said, “This is my son, whom I love; with Him I am well pleased. Listen to him!” I believe after that encounter they saw Jesus differently. If we will see Him as He truly is, it will strengthen our faith. It will change our view of life completely. If God will open our eyes to see Him in His glory, we can go out and debunk myths that keep other people from accepting Christ. Sometimes, it is our portrayal of God that stops other people from accepting Christ. Pray that God will help you to represent Him well to the world in a way that men would be drawn to Him instead of repelled by Him. ", I will be careful in how I carry myself and act with others. I will lead others to God instead of away from Him ," “LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken” (Psalm 16:5-8) "," Lord, help me to be a good ambassador of Christ everywhere I go. Draw men to yourself through my life and testimony of you."GOD OF ALL FLESH,6/19/18,"19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals (Genesis 2:19). ", Deuteronomy 17,"As human beings made in God’s image, we are tempted to exalt ourselves over everything. Indeed, man is superior to other animals because God gave man authority over them but God is superior over man still. Sometimes because of our challenges, we assume that God has lost control. Other times because of our position, we act like we don’t need God and have everything in our control. We try to exert the same authority God gave us over the earth over God Himself, our creator. The truth is that we have no control, authority and power of our own except that which God has given to us. I remember hearing stories of people that get upset because God has not yet performed their miracle and backslide. They say that they don’t want to serve God anymore. It is very flattering to think God needs us but the truth of the matter is that we need God more. We are created for His glory alone. Everything God does is centered on this notion. Perhaps you have just received your blessing, you still need God to maintain it. If you are still waiting for your blessing, you need God to provide it. Pray that you will not leave God for any reason because apart from Him, you can do nothing. In the book of John 15, Jesus said, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.  If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.” We need Jesus, our vine, to grow. Without Him, we would not flourish like God originally intended. Connect to God always. Don’t disconnect from your source."," I will not take credit for my existence and successes. I will give the glory back to God because apart from Him, I can accomplish nothing! ","LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.

Help me not to disconnect from my source as I go through life. I need you to help me to fulfill my destiny and life’s purpose."RELIABLE,6/20/18,"1 The hand of the LORD came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones. 2 Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and indeed they were very dry. 3 And He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” So I answered, “O Lord GOD, You know.” 4 Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! 5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. 6 I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.”’”(Ezekiel 37:1-6) ",Deuteronomy 18,"A  song by Shekinah Glory Ministry says, “Here is my heart, I give it Lord to You; Here is my life, I lay it before You; Where else would I go? What else would I do? If I did not know You? How deeply I need You, my Lord; Like the desert needs the rain, I need You; Like the ocean needs the streams, I need You; Like the morning needs the sun, I need You; Lord You are my only one”. This song confirms everything I believe about God. I need God because I am incomplete without Him. I cannot run my own life and be all that I am supposed to be outside of Him. Is it possible to be rich, successful and famous without God? Yes but there is a higher calling than wealth and riches. I want to fulfill the purpose for which I was created. Today, resolve in your mind that the answer to all of your life’s challenges is in God. The bible says that He is God who knows the beginning to the end. David astutely said in the book of Psalms 139 when he said about God,” You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.  You saw me before I was born. Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed.” The same is true for us. No one can make this claim, not parents, other gods, friends, therapist, psychologist, etc. God can put people in my life to help me in different situations but ultimately I know that it is God using them to help me. Lord, help me to continue to rely on You totally. To rely on God is not a sign of weakness because no one can exist alone. God knows how to orchestrate your life so that everything works together for good. I urge you to rely on Him today. He is a reliable and dependable God. ", I will rely on God today and stop relying on my strength or the strength of others alone. ,"“LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me.

Do not let me be ashamed in Jesus name."PRAISE WORTHY,6/21/18,"9 I will not take a bull from your house, Nor goats out of your folds. 10 For every beast of the forest is Mine, And the cattle on a thousand hills.11 I know all the birds of the mountains, And the wild beasts of the field are Mine.12 “If I were hungry, I would not tell you; For the world is Mine, and all its fullness.13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, Or drink the blood of goats?14 Offer to God thanksgiving, And pay your vows to the Most High.15 Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.”  (Psalm 50:9-15 )",Deuteronomy 19,"God is worthy of all our praise. He desires and deserves it.  I know you are asking yourself, “why should I praise Him when He hasn’t done anything for me lately?” The purpose of man’s creation was to give God glory and praise. The book of Revelation talks about God, sitting on a throne with twenty four thrones surrounding His throne. On these thrones sat twenty-four elders with crowns of gold on their heads yet they fall down before God and worship Him by laying their crowns before the throne and saying, “You are worthy, our Lord and God,  to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.” If elders with gold crowns are worshipping God in Heaven, who is man that He cannot bow to His maker? I want to point out that the elders were not worshipping God for the things He has done for them but for who He is. We can learn a lesson from this example. It is easy to worship God when He does good things for us. However, whether He does good things for us or not doesn’t diminish His worth. He is God in the good and bad times. He is in control even when things seem out of control. As such, we should reverence Him and give Him His due because that is what He wants from us. He cannot eat food, drink, spend our money but our praise He can take for Himself. There is a saying about when praises go up, blessings come down. This is true. King Solomon sacrificed 1000 burnt offerings to God at Gibeon. This prompted God to ask him in a dream, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.” Not only did God give him his request, God added extra blessings because He moved God in his worship. Move God with your “reckless” praise today. Praise Him not only for what He has done but praise Him especially for who He is. He will never share His glory with any man. Let your praises go up and receive the blessing of God for you and your family. ", I will praise God for who He is and not only for His blessings. ,"“LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken” (Psalm 16:5-8) "," Lord, I praise you for you alone are worthy of all my praise and worship. Forgive me for withholding my praises till you bless me."THE ULTIMATE,6/22/18,"1I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help come from? 2 My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. 3He will not let your foot slip—he who watches over you will not slumber; 4 indeed, he who watches over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 5 The LORD watches over you—the LORD is your shade at your right hand; the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. 7 The LORD will keep you from all harm—he will watch over your life; the LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore. (Psalm 121:1-2) ",Deuteronomy 20,"I remember hearing about a woman waiting on the Lord for a baby. After many years of faithfully waiting, she got tired. After all, hope deferred makes the heart sick. At a point, she was introduced to a witch doctor where she went to seek for “counsel” regarding the cause of the delay. She only wanted to know the cause of the delay but one thing led to another and she ended up having a baby with the witch doctor and leaving her marital home. It was a sad story because she was faithful initially. Her reason for going to the witch doctor was not to seek for a child, but to understand the cause of her delay in having children. All along, she had good intentions. The truth is that “every apple from the devil is full of worms though it looks juicy on the outside.” Any solution that we seek outside of God, whether through soothsayers, psychics, fortune tellers, diviner, oracle, etc. will have consequences because they are not our maker or creator. Some of the powers they consult cannot be found in God. No one goes to the inventor of a food blender to ask how to fix a problem with a Mercedes–Benz truck. Though, there is engineering involved in the manufacturing of both things, each inventor and manufacturer is an expert in their own area. God is the creator of our lives. He is the one that holds the patent to our lives and understand our design. Seek your solutions for problems in God. The bible is the ultimate answer to our problem. Seek biblical solution. There is nothing new under the sun. As you study the word of God, God can give you understanding of the problem Himself, He can direct you to people, or He can direct people your way. The one thing you can count on is that He will lead you. He might not answer in the way you think He should but He will listen, only be ready to follow His leading all the way and you will be successful. ",I will not seek solution outside of God for my life challenges. I will wait on God even if it is difficult. ,"“LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken” (Psalm 16:5-8) "," Lord, as I wait on you, let me experience you in a new dimension. Use my life to showcase your glory in the miracles that will come my way in Jesus name."THE RAT RACE,6/23/18,"10 Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. 11 Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: 12 not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger. 13 Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”14 What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! 15 For he says to Moses,“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”16 It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.  (Romans 9:10-16 ) ", Deuteronomy 21,"I have learned a lot from reading the book of Ecclesiastes in the bible. I was thought since childhood that if you study and work hard, you will automatically be successful. The place of God in our life is not well enunciated in my childish mind. However, in Chapter 9 of Ecclesiastes, King Solomon, a wealthy and wise king, wrote about time and seasons. He says that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all. In this day and age, this is a contrary way of thinking. At first, one might relegate this thought process to “old testament” thinking. However, a similar quote is seen in the new testament in the book of Romans Chapter 9. It talks about God’s conversation with Moses when He said He will have mercy and compassion on whom He chooses. If this is the case, regardless of the appearance, we don’t really do anything on our own. If our plans work out “without God,” it is only because He is merciful to us. It is not because we are wiser, privileged, smarter, charismatic, etc. If we look back at our lives, some people are better than we are and yet, they are not where we are. We forget that we have because He gives! Perhaps we are in a place where all our plans have not come to fruition yet. It is possible that we might have forgotten to include God in these plans. Go back and include God. Ask Him to help you to make your plans succeed if it is His will for you. If it is not His will, ask Him to lead you into His will. You will be happier being in His will than in your own plan outside of His will. Man has many plans but unless God approves those plans, they will not be executed. Invite God into your plans today. "," Apart from You, I can do nothing. I recognize this truth and invite You into all my plans today. ","“LORD, you alone are my portion and my cup; you make my lot secure.  The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance. I will praise the LORD, who counsels me; even at night my heart instructs me. I keep my eyes always on the LORD. With him at my right hand, I will not be shaken” (Psalm 16:5-8)","Lord, you are my source. I pray that I will always be in your Will in Jesus name."REMAIN IN CHRIST,6/24/18,"5 “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.  (John 15:5) ",:Deuteronomy 22,"In our Bible reading for today, Jesus describes Himself as the vine and us as the branches. The branch grows out of the vine and the vine holds the branches and supplies it with nutrients. The vine basically keeps the branch alive. The branch cannot survive if it falls off from the vine. As children of Jesus Christ, we need to remain in Him to thrive. Jesus knew from the foundation of the world that some of His children, whom He saved and who love Him, might come to a point in their walk with Him where they feel like giving up or feel weakened by the situations they face. But He said “remain in Me.” How do we remain in Christ? We remain in Christ by making a conscious decision every day to live out our relationship with Him. We need to make a new commitment to Him every day. In the same way that couples tell each other that they love each other, Christ wants to hear it from us too. He wants us to show that we love Him by the way we live our lives every day. We remain in Christ when His Word remains in us and we obey His commandments. Many Christians today do not understand or refuse to accept the fact that there are commandments that our Lord has given us that we must follow. Yes, we have grace, but we must also do what He says if we want to abide in Him. I urge you to remain in Christ and not let the devil take you off course. Do not get tired or too familiar with your love towards Christ. Renew your commitment and love to Him every day. ", Ask God to keep you in your daily walk with Him.," Remain in Me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. (John 15:4)","Dear Lord, help me to remain in you and in doing so, become more like you."FRUITFULNESS,6/25/18,"12 The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, they will grow like a cedar of Lebanon; 13 planted in the house of the Lord, they will flourish in the courts of our God. 14 They will still bear fruit in old age, they will stay fresh and green, 15 proclaiming, “The Lord is upright; he is my Rock, and there is no wickedness in him.” (Psalm 92:12-15) ",Deuteronomy 23,"As long as a prince remains in the palace or in His father’s territory, he enjoys the benefits of royalty. The moment he ventures into some other kingdom, without the royal backing, he no longer enjoys the benefits of royalty. When we remain in Christ, He helps us bear fruit. Bearing fruit as a Christian means that we develop the characteristics of Jesus. Just as a branch cannot produce fruits when it is cut off from a tree, we cannot bear fruit when we are no longer in Christ. The fruits, or the characteristics of the Holy Spirit, are love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23). Look at the world around us today. How many people can possess all of these traits on a consistent basis without a relationship with Christ? In fact, the world is daily and increasingly showing fruits that are opposite of these. People hardly love anymore, they chase happiness like its fleeting, they do not forgive and self-control is the hardest thing. As Christ rightly said, “neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.” You can only continue to bear fruit, or possess the aforementioned attributes, when you remain in Christ. When He dwells in you and you have a genuine connection to Him, the fruits naturally come to life. People around you can see and testify to them. You don’t force them, they just grow from within you. Do you have Christ in you? Are you remaining in Him? Do you read and listen to His Word? Do you practice them and obey His commands? Make strides to develop characteristics of Jesus. ", Ask for the fruits of the Spirit in prayer. Be sure to remain in Him.," Remain in Me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. (John 15:4)"," Lord, help me to remain in you so that I may bear fruit."THE MASTER GARDENER,6/26/18,“I am the true vine; my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch of mine that does not produce fruit. And he trims and cleans every branch that produces fruit so that it will produce even more fruit.” (John 15:1-2) , Deuteronomy 24,"Jesus Christ was talking to His children in today’s Bible reading. He informed us that God (the Father) is the Gardener (the one that takes care of the tree). When we, the branches, bear fruit like we are supposed to, God cleans and prunes our lives. He takes away every hindrance that would potentially keep us from growing. He gives us the ability to fulfill our purpose. But all of this can only be possible when we know Jesus Christ in the first place, and remain in Him. Do you have a personal relationship with Jesus? Can you confidently say to yourself “I am His child and He is my Father”? Are you still in Him and do you continue to see the evidence of a relationship with Him in your life? God is willing to make your life beautiful. He wants you to bear fruits and He wants to make it easier for you to fulfill your purpose. Resolve to develop and renew your relationship with Him today. The rewards are immense."," Be more purposeful about displaying the fruits of the Spirit. After you have prayed for them, start to practice them."," Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. (John 15:4)"," Lord, please clean up my life and make my life beautiful for your glory."DEAD BRANCHES,6/27/18,"“If any do not remain in me, they are like a branch that is thrown away and then dies. People pick up dead branches, throw them into the fire, and burn them.” (John 15:6) ", Deuteronomy 25,"In our reading today, Jesus explained that branches that do not remain on the tree will dry up and fall to the ground. When a branch is on the ground, it’s only natural for someone to pick it up and put it in the trash or burn it. The same thing happens to any child of God who does not remain in Christ. God promised us total security as long as we are His children. But we can only be assured of this total security as long as we truly remain in Him. The moment we drift off or no longer abide, we become open to all kinds of evil. The Bible informs us that the devil (our enemy) goes around looking to find any stray sheep that he may feast on. It is unwise to stray away from our Shepherd. In the same vein, it is not very smart to get used to or bored with Him, because then our relationship with Him is put in danger. The devil is always looking to catch us at our weakest times when we haven’t been praying or studying God’s Word like we should, when we haven’t been fellowshipping with like-minded believers like we ought to, or when we just stop paying as much attention to God like we used to. Those are times of great danger. Be on guard. Make sure you are conscious of your relationship with Jesus Christ. Pay attention to it and nurture it. Examine your life to see if you truly are bearing Christ-like fruits and stay connected to Him. Only when you make sure of these things can you be sure of total security.",Make sure of your standing in Christ every day.," Remain in Me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. (John 15:4)"," Lord, help me to remain in you and keep me from the evil one."A BLANK CHECK,6/28/18," “If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.” (John 15:7) ", Deuteronomy 26,"Who turns down a blank check? Imagine if the President of the Untied States visited you and asked you to make any request and you would have what you asked for. Our Heavenly Father who possesses all riches in glory, the One who created the Heavens and the earth, has given us a blank check. In our reading today, He said “ask whatever you wish”. He didn’t say ask for what you think I can do for you. He said whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. But there is a clause. You have to remain in Him and ask according to His will. The Bible is full of promises of God to bless those who obey Him. If you are not His child and are not in Him, He is not obligated to answer your prayers. He doesn’t owe you anything. However, if you are His child and remain in Him, He is obligated to answer your prayers because He has promised to do so in His Word. The Lord says He honors His Word more than His Name. He is the One that does what He says and you can take His Word to the bank. If you haven’t at any time given your life to Christ, now is the accepted time. Ask Him to come into your life. Yield your heart to Him. If you are already His child, rededicate yourself to Him. Examine your life to see if you are indeed in Him. Ask for His help to remain in Him. He is the only One that can help you to remain in Him. Don’t forget, you have a blank check, use it."," Fulfill your part of the deal. Remain in Christ, and you will have unlimited blank checks"," Remain in Me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. (John 15:4)","Lord, help me to remain in you. I want to enjoy the blessings of abiding in You..""IF YOU LOVE ME, DO WHAT I COMMAND",6/29/18,"“Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.  You are my friends if you do what I command.  I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.” (John 15:13-15) ", Deuteronomy 27 ,"There is a song that goes like this: I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God, I am a friend of God; He calls me friend. Who does God call His friends? In Matthew 7:21-24, Jesus Christ said  “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in Heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’ Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.” This verse illustrates to us that we are only considered His friend if we put what He says into practice. It’s nice to be called a Christian and go to church regularly, always be around people of God, and to maybe even sing in the choir, but if you do not do what God says and obey His commands, you are an alien to Him. Not knowing God’s commands or words is not an excuse for not doing them. As they say, ignorance is not an excuse before the law. That’s why God gave us His Word in the Bible. We need to read it for ourselves and find out all that God commands us to do, and then do it. Jesus Christ calls us to Himself and is interested in everyone being saved, but He also wants those whom He has called to obey His commands. That is the only way we can remain in Him. When we don’t, it becomes disobedience. Resolve to study God’s Word and obey His commands today and for the rest of this year. Therein lays the secret to being His friend.",Obey God in everything He commands. That’s how you show Him you love Him. ," Remain in Me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. (John 15:4)"," Lord, let me be your friend indeed. I want my life to show others that I know You and I am your friend."YOU NEED HIS HELP,6/30/18,"“I am coming to you now. But I pray these things while I am still in the world so that these followers can have all of my joy in them.  I have given them your teaching. And the world has hated them, because they don’t belong to the world, just as I don’t belong to the world. I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to keep them safe from the Evil One. They don’t belong to the world, just as I don’t belong to the world. (John 17:13-15) ", Deuteronomy 28,"Like Jesus Christ prayed in our reading today, we need to continue to pray for God to keep us safe from the evil one. Many people visualize the evil one as a dark monster with horns on his head. On the contrary, the evil one is all and anything that seeks to take you away from Jesus Christ. He may come to you in the most subtle and pleasant way possible. He may even come to you through a family member or your job. The evil one is very crafty and a lot wiser than we are. He has been here longer than we have. He knows all the possible ways to take us away from Christ. We need to continue to ask for help from God. “God is strong and can help you not to fall. He can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and can give you great joy” (Jude 1:24). It is only by His help that we can stay safe in this world. Safe from distractions of the world, safe from the evils in the world, and safe from the corrupting influence of the world. Remember, your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Pray without ceasing.",Pray without ceasing and put on the full armor of God in order to withstand the schemes of the enemy. ," Remain in Me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me. (John 15:4)"," Lord, give me the grace to resist the enemy. I need your help."
